"""This is the main program file for the auto grader program.
The auto grader assumes that the following files are in the same directory as the autograder:
  - autotraining.txt  --> file of tagged words used to train the HMM tagger
  - autotest.txt      --> file of untagged words to be tagged by the HMM
  - autosolution.txt  --> file with correct tags for autotest words
This auto grader generates a file called results.txt that records the test results.
