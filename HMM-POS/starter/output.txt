gazed ZZ0
doubtfully ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
plate ZZ0
before ZZ0
him ZZ0
. ZZ0
Having ZZ0
thought ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
hungry ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
now ZZ0
realized ZZ0
that ZZ0
actually ZZ0
he ZZ0
needed ZZ0
anything ZZ0
rather ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
overflowing ZZ0
plate ZZ0
of ZZ0
cholesterol ZZ0
the ZZ0
canteen ZZ0
at ZZ0
New ZZ0
Scotland ZZ0
Yard ZZ0
had ZZ0
provided ZZ0
with ZZ0
such ZZ0
admirable ZZ0
promptness ZZ0

Sleep ZZ0
would ZZ0
perhaps ZZ0
make ZZ0
more ZZ0
sense ZZ0
after ZZ0
thirty-six ZZ0
hours ZZ0
straight ZZ0
on ZZ0
duty ZZ0
, ZZ0
much ZZ0
of ZZ0
it ZZ0
spent ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
sullen ZZ0
Jamaican ZZ0
who ZZ0
had ZZ0
killed ZZ0
his ZZ0
landlady ZZ0
and ZZ0
her ZZ0
three ZZ0
children ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
crowded ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
house ZZ0
behind ZZ0
the ZZ0
Westway ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
took ZZ0
an ZZ0
experimental ZZ0
mouthful ZZ0
of ZZ0
fried ZZ0
egg ZZ0
and ZZ0
waited ZZ0
to ZZ0
see ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
suit ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
then ZZ0
progressed ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
baked ZZ0
beans ZZ0
, ZZ0
cautiously ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
finished ZZ0
the ZZ0
egg ZZ0
, ZZ0
all ZZ0
the ZZ0
baked ZZ0
beans ZZ0
and ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sausages ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
decided ZZ0
the ZZ0
fried ZZ0
bread ZZ0
was ZZ0
tempting ZZ0
fate ZZ0
and ZZ0
pushed ZZ0
the ZZ0
plate ZZ0
aside ZZ0
, ZZ0
reaching ZZ0
for ZZ0
his ZZ0
cup ZZ0
of ZZ0
tea ZZ0
, ZZ0
resting ZZ0
both ZZ0

on ZZ0
the ZZ0

He ZZ0
lifted ZZ0
a ZZ0

off ZZ0
his ZZ0

his ZZ0

At ZZ0

difficult ZZ0

one ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
twenty-four-year-old ZZ0
twins ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
proved ZZ0
the ZZ0
most ZZ0
difficult ZZ0
, ZZ0
perhaps ZZ0
because ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
not ZZ0
the ZZ0
most ZZ0
talented ZZ0

McLeish ZZ0
gritted ZZ0
his ZZ0
teeth ZZ0
, ZZ0

, ZZ0
trying ZZ0
not ZZ0
to ZZ0
consider ZZ0
the ZZ0
implications ZZ0
of ZZ0
what ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
told ZZ0
. ZZ0
made ZZ0
one ZZ0
quick ZZ0
phone ZZ0
call ZZ0

then ZZ0
took ZZ0
the ZZ0
lift ZZ0
down ZZ0

walked ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
road ZZ0
from ZZ0
New ZZ0
Scotland ZZ0
Yard ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
little ZZ0
cafe ZZ0

was ZZ0

as ZZ0
usual ZZ0
, ZZ0
full ZZ0
of ZZ0
workmen ZZ0
engaged ZZ0
in ZZ0

in ZZ0

to ZZ0
buy ZZ0
a ZZ0
paper ZZ0

caught ZZ0

through ZZ0

perched ZZ0
on ZZ0
one ZZ0

the ZZ0
bar ZZ0

stood ZZ0

watched ZZ0
her ZZ0

putting ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
moment ZZ0
when ZZ0
. ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
half ZZ0
knew ZZ0
, ZZ0

would ZZ0
be ZZ0
asked ZZ0
to ZZ0
acquiesce ZZ0
in ZZ0
some ZZ0
lunatic ZZ0
scheme ZZ0
for ZZ0
pulling ZZ0
Tristram ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
trouble ZZ0
, ZZ0

saw ZZ0
her ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
from ZZ0

tall ZZ0
young ZZ0

up ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0

had ZZ0
been ZZ0
crying ZZ0

pushed ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0

simply ZZ0
went ZZ0
to ZZ0
his ZZ0

what ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
like ZZ0
when ZZ0

heavily ZZ0

moved ZZ0

held ZZ0
on ZZ0
to ZZ0
his ZZ0
temper ZZ0

reminding ZZ0
himself ZZ0
that ZZ0

was ZZ0
very ZZ0
tired ZZ0

Francesca ZZ0
's ZZ0
much ZZ0
publicized ZZ0
affair ZZ0
with ZZ0

the ZZ0
reason ZZ0
that ZZ0

been ZZ0

early ZZ0
from ZZ0

tour ZZ0

over ZZ0
a ZZ0

met ZZ0
her ZZ0
in ZZ0
London ZZ0
. ZZ0
As ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
Francesca ZZ0
's ZZ0
DTI ZZ0
colleagues ZZ0
had ZZ0
maliciously ZZ0
observed ZZ0
, ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
felt ZZ0
that ZZ0
fraternization ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
American ZZ0
colleagues ZZ0
could ZZ0
be ZZ0
carried ZZ0
too ZZ0
far ZZ0
. ZZ0
Francesca ZZ0
herself ZZ0
had ZZ0
characteristically ZZ0
taken ZZ0
the ZZ0
line ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
Foreign ZZ0

ought ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
glad ZZ0
that ZZ0
someone ZZ0
on ZZ0

closely ZZ0
involved ZZ0

'll ZZ0
certainly ZZ0
be ZZ0
another ZZ0

" ZZ0
Her ZZ0
classically ZZ0
good ZZ0
diction ZZ0
always ZZ0
became ZZ0
even ZZ0
clearer ZZ0
under ZZ0

that ZZ0
this ZZ0
statement ZZ0
emerged ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
slightly ZZ0
metallic ZZ0
clarity ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
dubbed ZZ0
film ZZ0

and ZZ0
the ZZ0
clientele ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
small ZZ0
cafe ZZ0
was ZZ0
obviously ZZ0
appreciating ZZ0
every ZZ0

decided ZZ0
that ZZ0

it ZZ0
did ZZ0
not ZZ0
become ZZ0

selfconscious ZZ0

asked ZZ0
what ZZ0

Early ZZ0

n't ZZ0
expect ZZ0

late ZZ0
on ZZ0
Monday ZZ0
- ZZ0
I ZZ0
went ZZ0
off ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
some ZZ0
walking ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
weekend ZZ0
and ZZ0
was ZZ0
taking ZZ0
an ZZ0
extra ZZ0
day ZZ0
. ZZ0
I ZZ0
rang ZZ0
her ZZ0
on ZZ0
Monday ZZ0
night ZZ0
and ZZ0
got ZZ0
no ZZ0
answer ZZ0

that ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
worry ZZ0
me ZZ0

I ZZ0
was ZZ0
having ZZ0
lunch ZZ0
with ZZ0
her ZZ0
on ZZ0
Tuesday ZZ0

did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
turn ZZ0
up ZZ0

I ZZ0
then ZZ0
telephoned ZZ0

I ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
word ZZ0
with ZZ0

Perhaps ZZ0
I ZZ0
should ZZ0
have ZZ0
done ZZ0
it ZZ0

I ZZ0
suppose ZZ0

always ZZ0
afraid ZZ0

making ZZ0
a ZZ0
fool ZZ0

exercised ZZ0

cool ZZ0

five ZZ0

ten ZZ0

got ZZ0
half-way ZZ0
down ZZ0

the ZZ0
moment ZZ0

her ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
real ZZ0
reason ZZ0

be ZZ0

give ZZ0
me ZZ0
an ZZ0

was ZZ0
quite ZZ0
a ZZ0
good ZZ0

of ZZ0

in ZZ0

It ZZ0
's ZZ0
widely ZZ0
known ZZ0

that ZZ0

her ZZ0
points ZZ0
in ZZ0

that ZZ0
in ZZ0

an ZZ0
offensively ZZ0
elementary ZZ0
consideration ZZ0

' ZZ0
attention ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
drawn ZZ0

seem ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
felt ZZ0
, ZZ0

that ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
worth ZZ0
a ZZ0
lunch ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
She ZZ0
paused ZZ0

" ZZ0
I ZZ0
'd ZZ0
have ZZ0
to ZZ0
say ZZ0
that ZZ0
given ZZ0
the ZZ0
change ZZ0
of ZZ0

they ZZ0
ought ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
a ZZ0
very ZZ0
good ZZ0
chance ZZ0
of ZZ0
preventing ZZ0
us ZZ0
assisting ZZ0

I ZZ0
mean ZZ0
, ZZ0
this ZZ0
lot ZZ0
did ZZ0
come ZZ0
in ZZ0
, ZZ0
only ZZ0
six ZZ0
months ZZ0
ago ZZ0
, ZZ0
announcing ZZ0
that ZZ0
everyone ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
to ZZ0
stand ZZ0
on ZZ0
their ZZ0
own ZZ0
feet ZZ0

not ZZ0
be ZZ0
rescued ZZ0

face ZZ0
up ZZ0

all ZZ0
that ZZ0

whatever ZZ0
they ZZ0
said ZZ0

as ZZ0
you ZZ0
know ZZ0
they ZZ0
have ZZ0
n't ZZ0
actually ZZ0
done ZZ0
any ZZ0
of ZZ0
it ZZ0

- ZZ0
they ZZ0
did ZZ0
rescue ZZ0

Towyn ZZ0

, ZZ0
using ZZ0
tax-payers ZZ0

money ZZ0
, ZZ0
just ZZ0
like ZZ0
they ZZ0
said ZZ0

could ZZ0
have ZZ0
credibly ZZ0
warned ZZ0

that ZZ0

whatever ZZ0
the ZZ0
public ZZ0

there ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
real ZZ0
risk ZZ0
that ZZ0

would ZZ0
be ZZ0
bailed ZZ0
out ZZ0

was ZZ0
clear ZZ0
that ZZ0

was ZZ0
pushing ZZ0

The ZZ0
boy ZZ0
, ZZ0
unlike ZZ0
the ZZ0

, ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0

did ZZ0
not ZZ0

for ZZ0
ever ZZ0
; ZZ0
beyond ZZ0
the ZZ0
bridge ZZ0
, ZZ0

disused ZZ0
railway ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
along ZZ0
which ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
walking ZZ0
became ZZ0
built ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
so ZZ0
that ZZ0
water ZZ0
ran ZZ0
off ZZ0
it ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
pulled ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
close ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
to ZZ0
let ZZ0
a ZZ0
mixed ZZ0
string ZZ0
of ZZ0
horses ZZ0
and ZZ0
Ponies ZZ0
go ZZ0
past ZZ0
, ZZ0
waving ZZ0
shyly ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
rider ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
pretty ZZ0
, ZZ0
capable ZZ0
girl ZZ0
an ZZ0
unbridgeable ZZ0
two ZZ0
years ZZ0
older ZZ0
than ZZ0
him ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
watched ZZ0
her ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
went ZZ0
past ZZ0
at ZZ0
a ZZ0
walk ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
black ZZ0
Labrador ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
both ZZ0
gazing ZZ0
wistfully ZZ0
, ZZ0
their ZZ0
breath ZZ0
steaming ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
cold ZZ0
February ZZ0
morning ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
waited ZZ0
till ZZ0
the ZZ0
horses ZZ0
were ZZ0
well ZZ0
away ZZ0
and ZZ0
looked ZZ0
round ZZ0
the ZZ0
wide ZZ0
, ZZ0
flat ZZ0
landscape ZZ0
carefully ZZ0
before ZZ0
unclipping ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Way ZZ0
you ZZ0
go ZZ0
, ZZ0
Patty ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
he ZZ0
said ZZ0
softly ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
was ZZ0
off ZZ0
, ZZ0
hurling ZZ0
herself ZZ0
along ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
, ZZ0
all ZZ0
paws ZZ0
and ZZ0
flying ZZ0
ears ZZ0
, ZZ0
after ZZ0
a ZZ0
rabbit ZZ0
who ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
sitting ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
patch ZZ0
of ZZ0
sun ZZ0
but ZZ0
disappeared ZZ0
with ZZ0
contemptuous ZZ0
ease ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
came ZZ0
close ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
boy ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
told ZZ0
unequivocally ZZ0
not ZZ0
to ZZ0
let ZZ0
her ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
- ZZ0
the ZZ0
riding-school ZZ0
only ZZ0
used ZZ0
the ZZ0
land ZZ0
by ZZ0
grace ZZ0
of ZZ0
its ZZ0
owner ZZ0
and ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
shooting ZZ0
estate ZZ0
- ZZ0
but ZZ0
he ZZ0
hated ZZ0
keeping ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
straining ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
and ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
always ZZ0
come ZZ0
to ZZ0
his ZZ0
call ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
stood ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
laughing ZZ0
at ZZ0
her ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
cast ZZ0
furiously ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
vanished ZZ0
rabbit ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
walked ZZ0
on ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
catch ZZ0
her ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
along ZZ0
the ZZ0
raised ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
trees ZZ0
had ZZ0
grown ZZ0
up ZZ0
beside ZZ0
it ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
twenty-five ZZ0
years ZZ0
since ZZ0
the ZZ0
railway ZZ0
had ZZ0
closed ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
boy ZZ0
stopped ZZ0
every ZZ0
now ZZ0
and ZZ0
then ZZ0
to ZZ0
watch ZZ0
small ZZ0
birds ZZ0
hopping ZZ0
around ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
branches ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
particularly ZZ0
liked ZZ0
this ZZ0
stretch ZZ0
; ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
but ZZ0
the ZZ0
odd ZZ0
tractor ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
horses ZZ0
ever ZZ0
came ZZ0
down ZZ0
this ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
birds ZZ0
were ZZ0
unworried ZZ0
by ZZ0
his ZZ0
presence ZZ0
. ZZ0
After ZZ0
half ZZ0
a ZZ0
mile ZZ0
he ZZ0
decided ZZ0
to ZZ0
turn ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
and ZZ0
walk ZZ0
up ZZ0
the ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
next ZZ0
field ZZ0
and ZZ0
along ZZ0
the ZZ0
path ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
of ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
following ZZ0
the ZZ0
horses ZZ0
whom ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
still ZZ0
see ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
distance ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
called ZZ0
Patty ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
come ZZ0
, ZZ0
which ZZ0
was ZZ0
surprising ZZ0
; ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
docile ZZ0
creature ZZ0
and ZZ0
particularly ZZ0
devoted ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
because ZZ0
he ZZ0
always ZZ0
took ZZ0
her ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
walk ZZ0
when ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
stables ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
could ZZ0
hear ZZ0
her ZZ0
barking ZZ0
and ZZ0
looked ZZ0
down ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
steep ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
bottom ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
trees ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
called ZZ0
her ZZ0
again ZZ0
and ZZ0
again ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
not ZZ0
stop ZZ0
barking ZZ0
at ZZ0
something ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
not ZZ0
see ZZ0
. ZZ0
Probably ZZ0
a ZZ0
squirrel ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
decided ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
slithered ZZ0
down ZZ0
the ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
to ZZ0
join ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
scolding ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
went ZZ0
. ZZ0
Straightening ZZ0
up ZZ0
beside ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
looked ZZ0
where ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
looking ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
blinked ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
saw ZZ0
a ZZ0
leg ZZ0
, ZZ0
uncomfortably ZZ0
wedged ZZ0
between ZZ0
sapling ZZ0
trees ZZ0
, ZZ0
swollen ZZ0
grotesquely ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
gazed ZZ0
at ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
stupidly ZZ0
, ZZ0
wondering ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
plastic ZZ0
. ZZ0
As ZZ0
his ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
focused ZZ0
he ZZ0
realized ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
looking ZZ0
at ZZ0
a ZZ0
hideously ZZ0
swollen ZZ0
human ZZ0
body ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
just ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
the ZZ0
light ZZ0
breeze ZZ0
shifted ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
caught ZZ0
the ZZ0
stomach-turning ZZ0
odour ZZ0
of ZZ0
decay ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
sensible ZZ0
and ZZ0
capable ZZ0
boy ZZ0
, ZZ0
an ZZ0
eldest ZZ0
child ZZ0
, ZZ0
so ZZ0
he ZZ0
moved ZZ0
closer ZZ0
, ZZ0
trying ZZ0
not ZZ0
to ZZ0
breathe ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
stood ZZ0
steadfastly ZZ0
looking ZZ0
until ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
confident ZZ0
of ZZ0
what ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
seen ZZ0
: ZZ0
a ZZ0
body ZZ0
, ZZ0
must ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
girl ZZ0
because ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
wearing ZZ0
a ZZ0
skirt ZZ0
, ZZ0
lying ZZ0
face ZZ0
down ZZ0
, ZZ0
head ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
bottom ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
as ZZ0
if ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
dived ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
clipped ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
on ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
with ZZ0
cold ZZ0
hands ZZ0
which ZZ0
would ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
function ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
let ZZ0
her ZZ0
pull ZZ0
him ZZ0
up ZZ0
the ZZ0
slope ZZ0
as ZZ0
fast ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
make ZZ0
his ZZ0
legs ZZ0
move ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
stopped ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
embankment ZZ0
, ZZ0
shaking ZZ0
with ZZ0
cold ZZ0
and ZZ0
shock ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
note ZZ0
the ZZ0
spot ZZ0
, ZZ0
then ZZ0
fled ZZ0
along ZZ0
the ZZ0
tractor ZZ0
paths ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
running ZZ0
with ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0

amazement ZZ0

leaned ZZ0
panting ZZ0
on ZZ0

the ZZ0
look ZZ0
that ZZ0
Miss ZZ0
Williams ZZ0
habitually ZZ0
bent ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
child ZZ0
who ZZ0
was ZZ0
riding ZZ0
carelessly ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
How ZZ0
long ZZ0
had ZZ0
she ZZ0
been ZZ0
there ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
Jamie ZZ0
asked ZZ0
, ZZ0
anxiously ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
A ZZ0
few ZZ0
days ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
the ZZ0
sergeant ZZ0
said ZZ0
, ZZ0
grimly ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
How ZZ0
many ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
" ZZ0
Doctor ZZ0
'll ZZ0
tell ZZ0
us ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
considered ZZ0
the ZZ0
boy ZZ0
thoughtfully ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
decided ZZ0
to ZZ0
take ZZ0
him ZZ0
back ZZ0
quickly ZZ0
. ZZ0
These ZZ0
teenagers ZZ0
were ZZ0
in ZZ0
his ZZ0
experience ZZ0
a ZZ0
lot ZZ0
less ZZ0
tough ZZ0
than ZZ0
they ZZ0
looked ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Any ZZ0
idea ZZ0
who ZZ0
it ZZ0
could ZZ0
be ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
he ZZ0
asked ZZ0
Miss ZZ0
Williams ZZ0
casually ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
No ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
only ZZ0
a ZZ0
local ZZ0
would ZZ0
know ZZ0
to ZZ0
put ZZ0
a ZZ0
body ZZ0
there ZZ0
. ZZ0
If ZZ0
Jamie ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
let ZZ0
the ZZ0
dog ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
lead ZZ0
she ZZ0
could ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
there ZZ0
much ZZ0
longer ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
The ZZ0
sergeant ZZ0
nodded ZZ0
, ZZ0
deciding ZZ0
it ZZ0
could ZZ0
do ZZ0
no ZZ0
harm ZZ0
to ZZ0
concede ZZ0
a ZZ0
point ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
already ZZ0
taken ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
No ZZ0
one ZZ0
could ZZ0
tell ZZ0
who ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
surely ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
Miss ZZ0
Williams ZZ0
said ZZ0
quietly ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
sounding ZZ0
shaky ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
She ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
even ZZ0
look ZZ0
human ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
The ZZ0
sergeant ZZ0
confirmed ZZ0
that ZZ0
that ZZ0
happened ZZ0
with ZZ0
bodies ZZ0
after ZZ0
a ZZ0
few ZZ0
days ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
We ZZ0
'll ZZ0
identify ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
though ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
he ZZ0
said ZZ0
, ZZ0
reassuringly ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Somebody ZZ0
will ZZ0
likely ZZ0
have ZZ0
reported ZZ0
her ZZ0
missing ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
stopped ZZ0
, ZZ0
abruptly ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
a ZZ0
conversation ZZ0
earlier ZZ0
that ZZ0
week ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
lit ZZ0
a ZZ0
cigarette ZZ0
, ZZ0
thinking ZZ0
furiously ZZ0
. ZZ0
This ZZ0
could ZZ0
be ZZ0
the ZZ0
girl ZZ0
whom ZZ0
the ZZ0
Yard ZZ0
were ZZ0
looking ZZ0
for ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
better ZZ0
do ZZ0
everything ZZ0
very ZZ0
quickly ZZ0
indeed ZZ0
, ZZ0
including ZZ0
finding ZZ0
his ZZ0
Chief ZZ0
, ZZ0
who ZZ0
would ZZ0
then ZZ0
want ZZ0
to ZZ0
find ZZ0
his ZZ0
Chief ZZ0
Constable ZZ0
and ZZ0
notify ZZ0
Scotland ZZ0
Yard ZZ0
. ZZ0
Presumably ZZ0
it ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
the ZZ0
Yard ZZ0
who ZZ0
investigated ZZ0
this ZZ0
one ZZ0
, ZZ0
rather ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
regional ZZ0
crime ZZ0
squad ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
chewed ZZ0
his ZZ0
thumbnail ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
walked ZZ0
, ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
long ZZ0
experience ZZ0
keeping ZZ0
in ZZ0
mind ZZ0
the ZZ0
highest ZZ0
priorities ZZ0
: ZZ0
Ensure ZZ0
Body ZZ0
Not ZZ0
Moved ZZ0
and ZZ0
Ensure ZZ0
Next ZZ0
of ZZ0
Kin ZZ0
Notified ZZ0
before ZZ0
the ZZ0
Press ZZ0
got ZZ0
the ZZ0
story ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
posted ZZ0
the ZZ0
detective ZZ0
constable ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
with ZZ0
him ZZ0
back ZZ0
down ZZ0
the ZZ0
path ZZ0
to ZZ0
join ZZ0
his ZZ0
colleague ZZ0
, ZZ0
armed ZZ0
with ZZ0
instructions ZZ0
to ZZ0
repel ZZ0
all ZZ0
attempts ZZ0
by ZZ0
anyone ZZ0
, ZZ0
however ZZ0
senior ZZ0
or ZZ0
armed ZZ0
with ZZ0
whatever ZZ0
authority ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
go ZZ0
anywhere ZZ0
near ZZ0
the ZZ0
body ZZ0
unless ZZ0
he ZZ0
, ZZ0
Sergeant ZZ0
Black ZZ0
, ZZ0
personally ZZ0
accompanied ZZ0
them ZZ0
. ZZ0
Then ZZ0
he ZZ0
climbed ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
Land ZZ0
Rover ZZ0
beside ZZ0
his ZZ0
two ZZ0
passengers ZZ0
and ZZ0
drove ZZ0
off ZZ0
fast ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
aim ZZ0
of ZZ0
abandoning ZZ0
Jamie ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
custody ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
aunt ZZ0
as ZZ0
quickly ZZ0
as ZZ0
possible ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
could ZZ0
see ZZ0
with ZZ0
half ZZ0
an ZZ0
eye ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
kid ZZ0
's ZZ0
aunt ZZ0
was ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
confident ZZ0
, ZZ0
bossy ZZ0
, ZZ0
well-connected ZZ0
women ZZ0
with ZZ0
whom ZZ0
that ZZ0
part ZZ0
of ZZ0
Cambridgeshire ZZ0
was ZZ0
substantially ZZ0
over-provided ZZ0
. ZZ0
John ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0
his ZZ0
office ZZ0
, ZZ0
Saturday ZZ0
or ZZ0
no ZZ0
Saturday ZZ0
, ZZ0
telling ZZ0
himself ZZ0
he ZZ0
needed ZZ0
to ZZ0
catch ZZ0
up ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
paperwork ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
phone ZZ0
rang ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
picked ZZ0
it ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
frowning ZZ0
. ZZ0
One ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
pleasures ZZ0
of ZZ0
Saturday ZZ0
working ZZ0
was ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
phone ZZ0
did ZZ0
not ZZ0
ring ZZ0
all ZZ0
the ZZ0
time ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
voice ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
other ZZ0
end ZZ0
was ZZ0
plainly ZZ0
over-excited ZZ0
and ZZ0
it ZZ0
took ZZ0
him ZZ0
a ZZ0
minute ZZ0
to ZZ0
disentangle ZZ0
what ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
being ZZ0
told ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Oh ZZ0
congratulations ZZ0
, ZZ0
Charlie ZZ0
. ZZ0
Sorry ZZ0
, ZZ0
what ZZ0
did ZZ0
you ZZ0
say ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
again ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
" ZZ0
A ZZ0
little ZZ0
girl ZZ0
. ZZ0
Actually ZZ0
a ZZ0
very ZZ0
big ZZ0
girl ZZ0
as ZZ0
these ZZ0
things ZZ0
go ZZ0
, ZZ0
nine ZZ0
pounds ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
's ZZ0
fantastic ZZ0
, ZZ0
John ZZ0
, ZZ0
there ZZ0
she ZZ0
is ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
new ZZ0
person ZZ0
, ZZ0
lying ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
face ZZ0
, ZZ0
sound ZZ0
asleep ZZ0
. ZZ0
I ZZ0
've ZZ0
just ZZ0
left ZZ0
them ZZ0
and ZZ0
I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
going ZZ0
back ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
repressed ZZ0
the ZZ0
malicious ZZ0
thought ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
event ZZ0
might ZZ0
put ZZ0
Francesca ZZ0
's ZZ0
nose ZZ0
just ZZ0
a ZZ0
little ZZ0
bit ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
joint ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
utterly ZZ0
secure ZZ0
in ZZ0
her ZZ0
position ZZ0
as ZZ0
the ZZ0
only ZZ0
girl ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
Wilson ZZ0
family ZZ0
and ZZ0
now ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
another ZZ0
one ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
've ZZ0
got ZZ0
another ZZ0
bit ZZ0
of ZZ0
good ZZ0
news ZZ0
. ZZ0
Frannie ZZ0
's ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
able ZZ0
to ZZ0
bring ZZ0
Tristram ZZ0
home ZZ0
pretty ZZ0
soon ZZ0
, ZZ0
apparently ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
expressed ZZ0
qualified ZZ0
enthusiasm ZZ0
and ZZ0
Charlie ZZ0
assured ZZ0
him ZZ0
he ZZ0
felt ZZ0
exactly ZZ0
the ZZ0
same ZZ0
about ZZ0
his ZZ0
younger ZZ0
brother ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
The ZZ0
difficulty ZZ0
is ZZ0
that ZZ0
Perry ZZ0
does ZZ0
everything ZZ0
that ZZ0
bit ZZ0
better ZZ0
than ZZ0
Tristram ZZ0
. ZZ0
Not ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
is ZZ0
any ZZ0
excuse ZZ0
, ZZ0
John ZZ0
, ZZ0
I ZZ0
do ZZ0
know ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
paused ZZ0
, ZZ0
reminding ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
irresistibly ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
Labrador ZZ0
wondering ZZ0
how ZZ0
best ZZ0
to ZZ0
approach ZZ0
an ZZ0
acquaintance ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
to ZZ0
say ZZ0
, ZZ0
you ZZ0
see ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
I ZZ0
know ZZ0
you ZZ0
thought ZZ0
Frannie ZZ0
should ZZ0
n't ZZ0
have ZZ0
gone ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
's ZZ0
ruined ZZ0
your ZZ0
holiday ZZ0
plans ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
on ZZ0
behalf ZZ0
of ZZ0
us ZZ0
all ZZ0
, ZZ0
I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
sorry ZZ0
. ZZ0
I ZZ0
know ZZ0
the ZZ0
little ZZ0
boys ZZ0
lean ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
too ZZ0
much ZZ0
and ZZ0
I ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
gone ZZ0
if ZZ0
I ZZ0
could ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
coughed ZZ0
, ZZ0
embarrassed ZZ0
and ZZ0
a ZZ0
little ZZ0
pompous ZZ0
, ZZ0
very ZZ0
much ZZ0
conscious ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
new ZZ0
status ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
father ZZ0
, ZZ0
while ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
scant ZZ0
four ZZ0
years ZZ0
older ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
delinquent ZZ0
Tristram ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Anyway ZZ0
she ZZ0
should ZZ0
be ZZ0
back ZZ0
soon ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
Charlie ZZ0
concluded ZZ0
. ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
thanked ZZ0
him ZZ0
gravely ZZ0
, ZZ0
feeling ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
often ZZ0
did ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
Wilsons ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
being ZZ0
enveloped ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
large ZZ0
feather ZZ0
eiderdown ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
made ZZ0
restless ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
call ZZ0
, ZZ0
went ZZ0
down ZZ0
the ZZ0
corridor ZZ0
to ZZ0
where ZZ0
he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
Catherine ZZ0
Crane ZZ0
was ZZ0
also ZZ0
in ZZ0
, ZZ0
getting ZZ0
her ZZ0
office ZZ0
in ZZ0
order ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
stopped ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
door ZZ0
and ZZ0
smiled ZZ0
at ZZ0
her ZZ0
. ZZ0
Wearing ZZ0
jeans ZZ0
and ZZ0
a ZZ0
blue ZZ0
shirt ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
tugging ZZ0
at ZZ0
a ZZ0
filing ZZ0
cabinet ZZ0
which ZZ0
was ZZ0
too ZZ0
large ZZ0
for ZZ0
her ZZ0
to ZZ0
embrace ZZ0
and ZZ0
which ZZ0
was ZZ0
threatening ZZ0
to ZZ0
over-balance ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
looked ZZ0
about ZZ0
sixteen ZZ0
and ZZ0
beautiful ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
let ZZ0
go ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
cabinet ZZ0
, ZZ0
coughing ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
dust ZZ0
of ZZ0
ages ZZ0
that ZZ0
appeared ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
lurking ZZ0
behind ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
smiled ZZ0
back ZZ0
at ZZ0
him ZZ0
as ZZ0
the ZZ0
February ZZ0
sun ZZ0
shone ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0
small ZZ0
window ZZ0
behind ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
throwing ZZ0
into ZZ0
sharp ZZ0
relief ZZ0
the ZZ0
patches ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
wall ZZ0
where ZZ0
her ZZ0
predecessor ZZ0
had ZZ0
hung ZZ0
posters ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
ingrained ZZ0
dirt ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
flaking ZZ0
paintwork ZZ0
round ZZ0
the ZZ0
mean ZZ0
, ZZ0
narrow ZZ0
, ZZ0
metal ZZ0
window ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
Where ZZ0
do ZZ0
you ZZ0
want ZZ0
that ZZ0
put ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
McLeish ZZ0
advanced ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
cabinet ZZ0
and ZZ0
shifted ZZ0
it ZZ0
authoritatively ZZ0
, ZZ0
ignoring ZZ0
the ZZ0
clip ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
ankle ZZ0
dealt ZZ0
him ZZ0
by ZZ0
an ZZ0
unsecured ZZ0
bottom ZZ0
drawer ZZ0
apparently ZZ0
full ZZ0
of ZZ0
bricks ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
should ZZ0
have ZZ0
unloaded ZZ0
it ZZ0
first ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
Catherine ZZ0
Crane ZZ0
said ZZ0
, ZZ0
apologetically ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
but ZZ0
I ZZ0
just ZZ0
could ZZ0
n't ZZ0
move ZZ0
in ZZ0
any ZZ0
direction ZZ0
with ZZ0
it ZZ0

it ZZ0
was ZZ0

" ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
here ZZ0
, ZZ0
just ZZ0
tell ZZ0
me ZZ0
if ZZ0
you ZZ0
want ZZ0
anything ZZ0

. ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
hesitated ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
another ZZ0
hour ZZ0
, ZZ0
then ZZ0
have ZZ0
some ZZ0
lunch ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
you ZZ0
want ZZ0
to ZZ0
come ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
aware ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
not ZZ0
managing ZZ0
to ZZ0
sound ZZ0
exactly ZZ0
like ZZ0
a ZZ0
senior ZZ0
officer ZZ0
making ZZ0
a ZZ0
recent ZZ0
arrival ZZ0
feel ZZ0
at ZZ0
home ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
decided ZZ0
not ZZ0
to ZZ0
add ZZ0
any ZZ0
further ZZ0
riders ZZ0
to ZZ0
his ZZ0
invitation ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
That ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
very ZZ0
nice ZZ0
. ZZ0
Are ZZ0
we ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
canteen ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
" ZZ0
Not ZZ0
if ZZ0
I ZZ0
can ZZ0
help ZZ0
it ZZ0
. ZZ0
What ZZ0
about ZZ0
the ZZ0
pub ZZ0
? ZZ0
" ZZ0
If ZZ0
I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
allowed ZZ0
to ZZ0
buy ZZ0
my ZZ0
own ZZ0

McLeish ZZ0
considered ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
That ZZ0
's ZZ0
fine ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
food ZZ0
- ZZ0
I ZZ0
'll ZZ0
buy ZZ0

'm ZZ0
too ZZ0
old ZZ0
to ZZ0

to ZZ0

buying ZZ0
my ZZ0
drinks ZZ0

" ZZ0
She ZZ0
laughed ZZ0
at ZZ0
him ZZ0
and ZZ0
said ZZ0
gravely ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
happy ZZ0
to ZZ0
indulge ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
went ZZ0
away ZZ0
, ZZ0
grinning ZZ0
. ZZ0
Peter ZZ0
Yeo ZZ0
was ZZ0
also ZZ0
in ZZ0
his ZZ0
office ZZ0
, ZZ0
having ZZ0
told ZZ0
his ZZ0
wife ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
lunching ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
client ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
felt ZZ0
, ZZ0
just ZZ0
too ZZ0
difficult ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
at ZZ0
home ZZ0
at ZZ0
all ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
Claudia ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
permanently ZZ0
bitchy ZZ0
mood ZZ0
and ZZ0
both ZZ0
his ZZ0
teenage ZZ0
children ZZ0
taking ZZ0
their ZZ0
cue ZZ0
from ZZ0
her ZZ0
and ZZ0
behaving ZZ0
intolerably ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
wandered ZZ0
restlessly ZZ0
about ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
decided ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
lie ZZ0
might ZZ0
as ZZ0
well ZZ0
become ZZ0
the ZZ0
truth ZZ0
. ZZ0
Without ZZ0
Angela ZZ0
Morgan ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
two ZZ0
major ZZ0
clients ZZ0
were ZZ0
in ZZ0
danger ZZ0
of ZZ0
not ZZ0
getting ZZ0
the ZZ0
assiduous ZZ0
service ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
paying ZZ0
for ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
it ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
well ZZ0
worth ZZ0
trying ZZ0
to ZZ0
see ZZ0
if ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
them ZZ0
, ZZ0
whom ZZ0
he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
fellow ZZ0
refugee ZZ0
from ZZ0
family ZZ0
life ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
weekends ZZ0
, ZZ0
could ZZ0
be ZZ0
found ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0
luck ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
fixed ZZ0
to ZZ0
meet ZZ0
Andy ZZ0
Barton ZZ0
at ZZ0
Brazzo ZZ0
's ZZ0
where ZZ0
Yeo ZZ0
Davis ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
table ZZ0
permanently ZZ0
booked ZZ0

He ZZ0
had ZZ0
to ZZ0
admit ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
particular ZZ0
client ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
added ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
general ZZ0
decorative ZZ0
smartness ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
place ZZ0
. ZZ0
Andy ZZ0
Barton ZZ0
, ZZ0
founder ZZ0
and ZZ0
chief ZZ0
executive ZZ0
of ZZ0
Barton ZZ0
Textiles ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
almost ZZ0
as ZZ0
broad ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
long ZZ0
, ZZ0
virtually ZZ0
neckless ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
incongruously ZZ0
long ZZ0
brown ZZ0
hair ZZ0
curling ZZ0
over ZZ0
his ZZ0
collar ZZ0
. ZZ0
His ZZ0
enormous ZZ0
hands ZZ0
dwarfed ZZ0
the ZZ0
elegant ZZ0
menu ZZ0
which ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
studying ZZ0
in ZZ0
apparent ZZ0
disbelief ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
Peter ZZ0
Yeo ZZ0
noticed ZZ0
again ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
Barton ZZ0
without ZZ0
rising ZZ0
extended ZZ0
one ZZ0
massive ZZ0
paw ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
though ZZ0
the ZZ0
fingers ZZ0
were ZZ0
an ZZ0
ordinary ZZ0
length ZZ0

was ZZ0
the ZZ0
width ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0

made ZZ0
the ZZ0

so ZZ0
large ZZ0
