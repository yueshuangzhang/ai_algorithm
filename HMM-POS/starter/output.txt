Here ZZ0
a ZZ0
right ZZ0
turn ZZ0
took ZZ0
him ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
coastal ZZ0
road ZZ0
on ZZ0
to ZZ0
what ZZ0
was ZZ0
little ZZ0
more ZZ0
than ZZ0
a ZZ0
smoothly ZZ0
macadamed ZZ0

bordered ZZ0
by ZZ0
water-filled ZZ0

And ZZ0
now ZZ0
, ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
time ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
thought ZZ0
that ZZ0

could ZZ0
smell ZZ0
the ZZ0
North ZZ0

, ZZ0
that ZZ0
potent ZZ0

half-illusory ZZ0
tang ZZ0
evoking ZZ0
nostalgic ZZ0
memories ZZ0

, ZZ0
of ZZ0
solitary ZZ0
adolescent ZZ0

he ZZ0
struggled ZZ0
with ZZ0
his ZZ0

of ZZ0

tall ZZ0
figure ZZ0
at ZZ0

And ZZ0
here ZZ0
, ZZ0
barring ZZ0
the ZZ0

, ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
familiar ZZ0
old ZZ0
farm ZZ0
gate ZZ0
still ZZ0
in ZZ0
place ZZ0
. ZZ0
Its ZZ0
continued ZZ0
presence ZZ0
always ZZ0
surprised ZZ0
him ZZ0
since ZZ0
it ZZ0
served ZZ0
no ZZ0
purpose ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
see ZZ0
except ZZ0
symbolically ZZ0
to ZZ0
cut ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0

to ZZ0
give ZZ0

pause ZZ0

really ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
to ZZ0
continue ZZ0

It ZZ0
swung ZZ0
open ZZ0
at ZZ0
his ZZ0
touch ZZ0
but ZZ0
closing ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
always ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
more ZZ0
difficult ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
lugged ZZ0
and ZZ0
half ZZ0
lifted ZZ0
it ZZ0
into ZZ0
place ZZ0
and ZZ0
slipped ZZ0
the ZZ0
circle ZZ0
of ZZ0
wire ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
gatepost ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
familiar ZZ0
sensation ZZ0
of ZZ0
having ZZ0
turned ZZ0
his ZZ0
back ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
workaday ZZ0
world ZZ0
and ZZ0
entered ZZ0
country ZZ0
which ZZ0
, ZZ0
no ZZ0
matter ZZ0
how ZZ0
frequent ZZ0
his ZZ0
visits ZZ0
, ZZ0
would ZZ0
always ZZ0
be ZZ0
alien ZZ0
territory ZZ0

He ZZ0
was ZZ0
driving ZZ0
now ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
open ZZ0
headland ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
fringe ZZ0
of ZZ0
pine ZZ0

which ZZ0
bordered ZZ0
the ZZ0
North ZZ0
Sea ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
only ZZ0

to ZZ0
his ZZ0

was ZZ0
the ZZ0
old ZZ0
Victorian ZZ0

a ZZ0

, ZZ0
incongruous ZZ0
behind ZZ0

of ZZ0
rhododendron ZZ0

laurel ZZ0
. ZZ0
To ZZ0
his ZZ0
right ZZ0
the ZZ0
ground ZZ0
rose ZZ0
gently ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
southern ZZ0
cliffs ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
see ZZ0
the ZZ0
dark ZZ0
mouth ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
concrete ZZ0
pillbox ZZ0
, ZZ0
undemolished ZZ0
since ZZ0
the ZZ0

the ZZ0

of ZZ0

beyond ZZ0

The ZZ0

eventually ZZ0

the ZZ0

The ZZ0

precarious ZZ0

And ZZ0
now ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
passing ZZ0
a ZZ0

dilapidated ZZ0

it ZZ0
struck ZZ0
him ZZ0
that ZZ0

about ZZ0

With ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0

passed ZZ0
into ZZ0

It ZZ0
was ZZ0
much ZZ0
lighter ZZ0
than ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
expected ZZ0
, ZZ0
largely ZZ0
because ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
rear ZZ0
door ZZ0
, ZZ0
now ZZ0
open ZZ0

led ZZ0
to ZZ0
a ZZ0
glass ZZ0
extension ZZ0
giving ZZ0
a ZZ0
view ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0

was ZZ0
aware ZZ0
of ZZ0

, ZZ0
the ZZ0
central ZZ0
wooden ZZ0
table ZZ0
still ZZ0

nursing ZZ0

of ZZ0
the ZZ0
smell ZZ0
of ZZ0
milk ZZ0
and ZZ0

and ZZ0
wood ZZ0
smoke ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
what ZZ0
held ZZ0
his ZZ0
attention ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
large ZZ0
oil ZZ0
painting ZZ0
propped ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
chair ZZ0
and ZZ0
fronting ZZ0
the ZZ0
door ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
three-quarter ZZ0
portrait ZZ0
in ZZ0

of ZZ0
a ZZ0
woman ZZ0
, ZZ0
painted ZZ0
with ZZ0
remarkable ZZ0
power ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
dominated ZZ0
the ZZ0
room ZZ0
so ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
and ZZ0
Alice ZZ0
Mair ZZ0
stood ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
, ZZ0
silently ZZ0
regarding ZZ0
it ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
painter ZZ0
had ZZ0
avoided ZZ0
caricature ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
only ZZ0
just ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
the ZZ0
portrait ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
felt ZZ0
, ZZ0
intended ZZ0
less ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
physical ZZ0
likeness ZZ0
than ZZ0
an ZZ0
allegory ZZ0
. ZZ0
Behind ZZ0
the ZZ0
wide ZZ0
, ZZ0
full ZZ0
mouth ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
arrogant ZZ0
stare ZZ0
of ZZ0

eyes ZZ0
, ZZ0

dark ZZ0
, ZZ0
crimped ZZ0
, ZZ0
Pre-Raphaelite ZZ0
hair ZZ0
streaming ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
wind ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
careful ZZ0
delineation ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
, ZZ0
its ZZ0
objects ZZ0
disposed ZZ0
and ZZ0
painted ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
meticulous ZZ0
attention ZZ0
to ZZ0
detail ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
sixteenth-century ZZ0
primitive ZZ0
; ZZ0
the ZZ0
Victorian ZZ0
rectory ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
ruined ZZ0
abbey ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
half-demolished ZZ0
pillbox ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
crippled ZZ0
trees ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
small ZZ0
white ZZ0
mill ZZ0
like ZZ0
a ZZ0
child ZZ0
's ZZ0
toy ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
gaunt ZZ0
against ZZ0
a ZZ0
flaming ZZ0
evening ZZ0
sky ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
stark ZZ0
outline ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
power ZZ0
station ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
woman ZZ0
, ZZ0
painted ZZ0
more ZZ0
freely ZZ0
, ZZ0
who ZZ0
dominated ZZ0
the ZZ0
landscape ZZ0
, ZZ0
arms ZZ0
stretched ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
palms ZZ0
facing ZZ0
outwards ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
parody ZZ0
of ZZ0
blessing ZZ0
. ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
's ZZ0
private ZZ0
verdict ZZ0
was ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
technically ZZ0
brilliant ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
overwrought ZZ0
and ZZ0
painted ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
felt ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
hatred ZZ0
. ZZ0
Blaney ZZ0
's ZZ0
intention ZZ0
to ZZ0
produce ZZ0
a ZZ0
study ZZ0
of ZZ0
evil ZZ0
was ZZ0
as ZZ0
clear ZZ0
as ZZ0
if ZZ0
the ZZ0
portrait ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
labelled ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
so ZZ0
different ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
artist ZZ0
's ZZ0
usual ZZ0
work ZZ0
that ZZ0
without ZZ0
the ZZ0
bold ZZ0
signature ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
single ZZ0
surname ZZ0
, ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
might ZZ0
have ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
fact ZZ0
, ZZ0
his ZZ0
work ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
recalled ZZ0
Blaney ZZ0
's ZZ0
pallid ZZ0
and ZZ0
innocuous ZZ0
watercolours ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
better-known ZZ0
beauty ZZ0
spots ZZ0
of ZZ0
Norfolk ZZ0
: ZZ0
Blakeney ZZ0
, ZZ0
St ZZ0
Peter ZZ0
Mancroft ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
cathedral ZZ0
at ZZ0
Norwich ZZ0
, ZZ0
which ZZ0
he ZZ0
produced ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
local ZZ0
shops ZZ0
. ZZ0
They ZZ0
could ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
painted ZZ0
from ZZ0
picture ZZ0
postcards ZZ0
and ZZ0
probably ZZ0
were ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
recall ZZ0
seeing ZZ0
one ZZ0
or ZZ0
two ZZ0
small ZZ0
oils ZZ0
hung ZZ0
in ZZ0
local ZZ0
restaurants ZZ0
and ZZ0
pubs ZZ0
, ZZ0
slap-dash ZZ0
in ZZ0
technique ZZ0
and ZZ0
economical ZZ0
of ZZ0
paint ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
so ZZ0
different ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
prettified ZZ0
watercolours ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
hard ZZ0
to ZZ0
believe ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
too ZZ0
were ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
same ZZ0
hand ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
this ZZ0
portrait ZZ0
was ZZ0
different ZZ0
from ZZ0
either ZZ0
; ZZ0
the ZZ0
wonder ZZ0
was ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
artist ZZ0
who ZZ0
could ZZ0
produce ZZ0
this ZZ0
disciplined ZZ0
splurge ZZ0
of ZZ0
colour ZZ0
, ZZ0
this ZZ0
technical ZZ0
artistry ZZ0
and ZZ0
imagination ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
content ZZ0
to ZZ0
churn ZZ0
out ZZ0
meretricious ZZ0
souvenirs ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
tourist ZZ0
trade ZZ0

a ZZ0

the ZZ0

In ZZ0

whether ZZ0

on ZZ0
the ZZ0

seen ZZ0
it ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
refuge ZZ0
from ZZ0
London ZZ0

eccentric ZZ0

remote ZZ0

providing ZZ0
a ZZ0

escape ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
demands ZZ0

his ZZ0

the ZZ0

But ZZ0
how ZZ0
far ZZ0

even ZZ0
as ZZ0

could ZZ0
he ZZ0
isolate ZZ0

private ZZ0
tragedies ZZ0
no ZZ0

It ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
simple ZZ0
enough ZZ0

avoid ZZ0
their ZZ0

sufficient ZZ0
ruthlessness ZZ0

never ZZ0
lacked ZZ0
that ZZ0
when ZZ0

But ZZ0
the ZZ0
less ZZ0

It ZZ0

But ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
glad ZZ0

offer ZZ0
some ZZ0
assurance ZZ0

He ZZ0

his ZZ0

something ZZ0

precision ZZ0

contrived ZZ0
charm ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0

with ZZ0
an ZZ0
almost ZZ0
round ZZ0

bright ZZ0

caught ZZ0
the ZZ0

trembled ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0

so ZZ0
that ZZ0

As ZZ0

not ZZ0

her ZZ0

In ZZ0

the ZZ0
end ZZ0

, ZZ0
the ZZ0
end ZZ0
of ZZ0
all ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
planned ZZ0
and ZZ0
hoped ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
. ZZ0
Amy ZZ0
was ZZ0
typing ZZ0
envelopes ZZ0
, ZZ0
sending ZZ0
out ZZ0
the ZZ0
final ZZ0
copies ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
newsletter ZZ0
. ZZ0
A ZZ0
pile ZZ0
was ZZ0
already ZZ0
to ZZ0
hand ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
began ZZ0
folding ZZ0
the ZZ0
pamphlets ZZ0
and ZZ0
inserting ZZ0
them ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
envelopes ZZ0
. ZZ0
The AT0
job NN1
was VBD
n't XX0
easy AJ0-AV0
. PUN
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
tried ZZ0
to ZZ0
economize ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
size ZZ0
and ZZ0
quality ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
envelopes ZZ0
were ZZ0
in ZZ0
danger ZZ0
of ZZ0
splitting ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
now ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
mailing ZZ0
list ZZ0
of ZZ0
250 ZZ0
, ZZ0
only ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
minority ZZ0
of ZZ0
whom ZZ0
were ZZ0
active ZZ0
supporters ZZ0
of ZZ0
PANUP ZZ0
. ZZ0
Most ZZ0
never ZZ0
paid ZZ0
any ZZ0
dues ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
organization ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
majority ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
pamphlets ZZ0
went ZZ0
unsolicited ZZ0
to ZZ0
public ZZ0
authorities ZZ0
, ZZ0
local ZZ0
firms ZZ0
and ZZ0
industry ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
vicinity ZZ0
of ZZ0
Larksoken ZZ0
and ZZ0
Sizewell ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
how ZZ0
many ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
250 ZZ0
were ZZ0
read ZZ0
and ZZ0
thought ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
sudden ZZ0
spasm ZZ0
of ZZ0
anxiety ZZ0
and ZZ0
depression ZZ0
, ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
total ZZ0
cost ZZ0
of ZZ0
even ZZ0
this ZZ0
small ZZ0
enterprise ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
this ZZ0
month ZZ0
's ZZ0
newsletter ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
his ZZ0
best ZZ0
. ZZ0
Rereading ZZ0
one ZZ0
before ZZ0
he ZZ0
put ZZ0
it ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
envelope ZZ0
, ZZ0
it ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
ill-organized ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
no ZZ0
coherent ZZ0
theme ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
principal ZZ0
aim ZZ0
now ZZ0
was ZZ0
to ZZ0
refute ZZ0
the ZZ0
growing ZZ0
argument ZZ0
that ZZ0
nuclear ZZ0
power ZZ0
could ZZ0
avoid ZZ0
the ZZ0
damage ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
environment ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0
greenhouse ZZ0
effect ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
the ZZ0
mixture ZZ0
of ZZ0
suggestions ZZ0
ranging ZZ0
from ZZ0
solar ZZ0
power ZZ0
to ZZ0
replacing ZZ0
light ZZ0
bulbs ZZ0
with ZZ0
those ZZ0
which ZZ0
consumed ZZ0
seventy-five ZZ0
per ZZ0
cent ZZ0
less ZZ0
energy ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
naive ZZ0
and ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
convincing ZZ0
. ZZ0
His ZZ0
article ZZ0
argued ZZ0
that ZZ0
nuclear-generated ZZ0
electricity ZZ0
could ZZ0
n't ZZ0
realistically ZZ0
replace ZZ0
oil ZZ0
and ZZ0
fossil ZZ0
fuels ZZ0
unless ZZ0
all ZZ0
nations ZZ0
built ZZ0
sixteen ZZ0
new ZZ0
reactors ZZ0
a ZZ0
week ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
five ZZ0
years ZZ0
from ZZ0
1995 ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
programme ZZ0
impossible ZZ0
to ZZ0
achieve ZZ0
and ZZ0
one ZZ0
which ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
practicable ZZ0
, ZZ0
would ZZ0
add ZZ0
intolerably ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
nuclear ZZ0
threat ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
the ZZ0
statistics ZZ0
, ZZ0
like ZZ0
all ZZ0
his ZZ0
figures ZZ0
, ZZ0
were ZZ0
culled ZZ0
from ZZ0
a ZZ0
variety ZZ0
of ZZ0
sources ZZ0
and ZZ0
lacked ZZ0
authority ZZ0
. ZZ0
Nothing ZZ0
he ZZ0
produced ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
genuinely ZZ0
his ZZ0
own ZZ0
work ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
the ZZ0
rest ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
newsletter ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
jumble ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
usual ZZ0
scare ZZ0
stories ZZ0
, ZZ0
most ZZ0
of ZZ0
which ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
used ZZ0
before ZZ0
; ZZ0
allegations ZZ0
of ZZ0
safety ZZ0
breaches ZZ0
which ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
covered ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
doubts ZZ0
about ZZ0
the ZZ0
safety ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
ageing ZZ0
Magnox ZZ0
stations ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
unsolved ZZ0
problem ZZ0
of ZZ0
storing ZZ0
and ZZ0
transporting ZZ0
nuclear ZZ0
waste ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
this ZZ0
issue ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
hard ZZ0
put ZZ0
to ZZ0
it ZZ0
to ZZ0
find ZZ0
a ZZ0
couple ZZ0
of ZZ0
intelligent ZZ0
letters ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0

that ZZ0

in ZZ0

wakeful ZZ0

faintly ZZ0

His ZZ0
body ZZ0
ached ZZ0
for ZZ0

he ZZ0
would ZZ0
press ZZ0
his ZZ0

into ZZ0
the ZZ0
lumpy ZZ0

Sometimes ZZ0
, ZZ0
too ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
tormented ZZ0
by ZZ0
jealousy ZZ0

Without ZZ0
proof ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
convinced ZZ0
himself ZZ0
that ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
someone ZZ0

She ZZ0
would ZZ0
say ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
to ZZ0
walk ZZ0
alone ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0

And ZZ0
he ZZ0
would ZZ0
watch ZZ0
her ZZ0
go ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
certainty ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
meeting ZZ0
a ZZ0
lover ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
when ZZ0
she ZZ0
returned ZZ0
he ZZ0
would ZZ0
imagine ZZ0
that ZZ0

could ZZ0
see ZZ0
the ZZ0
glow ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
skin ZZ0

the ZZ0
satisfied ZZ0
smile ZZ0

could ZZ0
almost ZZ0
smell ZZ0

been ZZ0
making ZZ0

He ZZ0
had ZZ0
already ZZ0
heard ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
university ZZ0
that ZZ0
his ZZ0
research ZZ0
grant ZZ0
would ZZ0
not ZZ0
be ZZ0
extended ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
decision ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
surprising ZZ0
; ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
warned ZZ0
to ZZ0
expect ZZ0
it ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
saving ZZ0
as ZZ0
much ZZ0
as ZZ0
possible ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0

in ZZ0
the ZZ0
hope ZZ0
of ZZ0
amassing ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
sum ZZ0
which ZZ0
would ZZ0
tide ZZ0
him ZZ0
over ZZ0
until ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
find ZZ0
a ZZ0
local ZZ0
job ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
mattered ZZ0
what ZZ0
. ZZ0
Anything ZZ0
that ZZ0
would ZZ0
pay ZZ0
enough ZZ0
to ZZ0
live ZZ0
and ZZ0
allow ZZ0
him ZZ0
to ZZ0
remain ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
to ZZ0
carry ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
campaign ZZ0

In ZZ0
theory ZZ0
he ZZ0
supposed ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
organize ZZ0
PANUP ZZ0
from ZZ0
anywhere ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
UK ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
irrevocably ZZ0
bound ZZ0
to ZZ0
Larksoken ZZ0
headland ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
caravan ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
that ZZ0
concrete ZZ0
mass ZZ0
five ZZ0

to ZZ0
the ZZ0
north ZZ0
which ZZ0
had ZZ0
power ZZ0
, ZZ0
apparently ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
dominate ZZ0
his ZZ0
will ZZ0
as ZZ0
it ZZ0
did ZZ0
his ZZ0
imagination ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
already ZZ0
put ZZ0
out ZZ0
feelers ZZ0
with ZZ0
local ZZ0
employers ZZ0
but ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
been ZZ0
too ZZ0
keen ZZ0
on ZZ0
employing ZZ0
a ZZ0
well-known ZZ0
agitator ZZ0
; ZZ0
even ZZ0
those ZZ0
who ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
sympathetic ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
anti-nuclear ZZ0
cause ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
actually ZZ0
have ZZ0
work ZZ0

. ZZ0
Perhaps ZZ0
they ZZ0
feared ZZ0
that ZZ0
too ZZ0
many ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
energies ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
diverted ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
campaign ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
his ZZ0
small ZZ0
capital ZZ0
was ZZ0
draining ZZ0

the ZZ0
extra ZZ0

the ZZ0

Apparently ZZ0
now ZZ0
even ZZ0

be ZZ0
followed ZZ0

threat ZZ0

there ZZ0
is ZZ0
a ZZ0
positive ZZ0

And ZZ0
the ZZ0

if ZZ0

that ZZ0

was ZZ0

For ZZ0
those ZZ0
who ZZ0
sought ZZ0
symbols ZZ0
in ZZ0
inanimate ZZ0
objects ZZ0
its ZZ0
message ZZ0
was ZZ0
both ZZ0
simple ZZ0
and ZZ0
expedient ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
man ZZ0
, ZZ0
by ZZ0
his ZZ0
own ZZ0
intelligence ZZ0
and ZZ0
his ZZ0
own ZZ0
efforts ZZ0
, ZZ0
could ZZ0
understand ZZ0
and ZZ0
master ZZ0
his ZZ0

could ZZ0
make ZZ0

transitory ZZ0

more ZZ0
agreeable ZZ0
, ZZ0
more ZZ0
comfortable ZZ0
, ZZ0
more ZZ0
free ZZ0
of ZZ0

For ZZ0
him ZZ0
this ZZ0
was ZZ0
challenging ZZ0
enough ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
if ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
needed ZZ0
a ZZ0
faith ZZ0
to ZZ0
live ZZ0
by ZZ0
it ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
starkly ZZ0
sufficient ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
sometimes ZZ0
, ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
darkest ZZ0
nights ZZ0
, ZZ0
when ZZ0
the ZZ0
waves ZZ0
pounded ZZ0
the ZZ0
shingle ZZ0
like ZZ0
bursts ZZ0
of ZZ0
distant ZZ0
gunfire ZZ0
, ZZ0
both ZZ0
the ZZ0
science ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
symbol ZZ0
would ZZ0
seem ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
as ZZ0
transitory ZZ0
as ZZ0
those ZZ0
drowned ZZ0
lives ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
would ZZ0
find ZZ0
himself ZZ0
wondering ZZ0
if ZZ0
this ZZ0
great ZZ0
hulk ZZ0
would ZZ0
one ZZ0
day ZZ0
yield ZZ0
to ZZ0

, ZZ0
like ZZ0
the ZZ0
wave-smashed ZZ0

from ZZ0

last ZZ0

and ZZ0
like ZZ0
them ZZ0

broken ZZ0
symbol ZZ0
of ZZ0

would ZZ0
it ZZ0
resist ZZ0
even ZZ0

North ZZ0

and ZZ0
still ZZ0
be ZZ0
standing ZZ0
when ZZ0
the ZZ0
final ZZ0
darkness ZZ0
fell ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0

? ZZ0
In ZZ0
his ZZ0
more ZZ0
pessimistic ZZ0
moments ZZ0
some ZZ0
rogue ZZ0
part ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
mind ZZ0
knew ZZ0
this ZZ0
darkness ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
inevitable ZZ0
, ZZ0
although ZZ0
he ZZ0
did ZZ0
not ZZ0
expect ZZ0
it ZZ0
to ZZ0
come ZZ0
in ZZ0
his ZZ0
time ZZ0
, ZZ0
maybe ZZ0
not ZZ0
even ZZ0
in ZZ0
his ZZ0
son ZZ0

. ZZ0
He ZZ0
would ZZ0
sometimes ZZ0
smile ZZ0
wryly ZZ0
, ZZ0
telling ZZ0
himself ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
and ZZ0
Neil ZZ0
Pascoe ZZ0
, ZZ0
on ZZ0
different ZZ0

would ZZ0
understand ZZ0

The AT0
only AJ0
difference NN1
was VBD
that CJT
one CRD

them PNP
had VHD
hope VVB
. PUN
Jane ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
had ZZ0
bought ZZ0
Larksoken ZZ0
Mill ZZ0
five ZZ0
years ZZ0
earlier ZZ0
when ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
moved ZZ0
from ZZ0
her ZZ0
previous ZZ0
home ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
Suffolk ZZ0
coast ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
mill ZZ0
, ZZ0
which ZZ0
was ZZ0
built ZZ0
in ZZ0
1525 ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
picturesque ZZ0
brick ZZ0
tower ZZ0
, ZZ0
four ZZ0
storeys ZZ0
high ZZ0
with ZZ0
an ZZ0
octagonal ZZ0
dome ZZ0
cap ZZ0
and ZZ0
skeleton ZZ0
fantail ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
converted ZZ0
some ZZ0
years ZZ0
before ZZ0
Miss ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
had ZZ0
bought ZZ0
it ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
addition ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
flint-faced ZZ0
, ZZ0
two-storey ZZ0
building ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
large ZZ0
sitting ZZ0
room ZZ0

smaller ZZ0
study ZZ0

a ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0

three ZZ0

, ZZ0
two ZZ0
of ZZ0
them ZZ0
with ZZ0
their ZZ0
own ZZ0
bathrooms ZZ0
, ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
floor ZZ0
above ZZ0
. ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
had ZZ0
never ZZ0
asked ZZ0
her ZZ0
why ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
moved ZZ0
to ZZ0
Norfolk ZZ0
but ZZ0
he ZZ0
guessed ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
mill ZZ0
's ZZ0
main ZZ0
attraction ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
its ZZ0
remoteness ZZ0
, ZZ0
its ZZ0
closeness ZZ0
to ZZ0
notable ZZ0
bird ZZ0
sanctuaries ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
impressive ZZ0
view ZZ0
of ZZ0
headland ZZ0
, ZZ0
sky ZZ0
and ZZ0
sea ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
storey ZZ0
. ZZ0
Perhaps ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
intended ZZ0
to ZZ0
restore ZZ0
it ZZ0
to ZZ0
working ZZ0
order ZZ0
but ZZ0
with ZZ0
increasing ZZ0
age ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
been ZZ0
able ZZ0
to ZZ0
summon ZZ0
the ZZ0
energy ZZ0
or ZZ0
enthusiasm ZZ0
to ZZ0
cope ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
disturbance ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
inherited ZZ0
it ZZ0
as ZZ0
an ZZ0
agreeable ZZ0
but ZZ0
mildly ZZ0
onerous ZZ0
responsibility ZZ0
, ZZ0
together ZZ0
with ZZ0
her ZZ0
considerable ZZ0
fortune ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
origin ZZ0
of ZZ0
that ZZ0
had ZZ0
only ZZ0
become ZZ0
plain ZZ0
after ZZ0
her ZZ0
death ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
had ZZ0
originally ZZ0
been ZZ0
left ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
by ZZ0
a ZZ0
noted ZZ0
amateur ZZ0
ornithologist ZZ0
and ZZ0
eccentric ZZ0
with ZZ0
whom ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
friendly ZZ0
for ZZ0
many ZZ0
years ZZ0
. ZZ0
Whether ZZ0
the ZZ0
relationship ZZ0
had ZZ0
gone ZZ0
beyond ZZ0
friendship ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
would ZZ0
now ZZ0
never ZZ0
know ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0
, ZZ0
apparently ZZ0
, ZZ0
spent ZZ0
little ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
money ZZ0
on ZZ0
herself ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
a ZZ0
dependable ZZ0
benefactress ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
few ZZ0
eccentric ZZ0
charities ZZ0
of ZZ0
which ZZ0
she ZZ0
approved ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
them ZZ0
in ZZ0
her ZZ0
will ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
without ZZ0
egregious ZZ0
generosity ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
left ZZ0
the ZZ0
residue ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
estate ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
without ZZ0
explanation ZZ0
, ZZ0
admonition ZZ0
or ZZ0
peculiar ZZ0
protestations ZZ0
of ZZ0
affection ZZ0
, ZZ0
although ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
no ZZ0
doubt ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
words ZZ0
" ZZ0
my ZZ0
dearly ZZ0
beloved ZZ0
nephew ZZ0
" ZZ0
meant ZZ0
exactly ZZ0
what ZZ0
they ZZ0
said ZZ0
. ZZ0
He PNP
had VHD
liked VVN
her PNP
, PUN
respected VVN
her PNP
, PUN
had VHD
always AV0
been VBN
at PRP
ease NN1
in PRP
her DPS

, PUN
but CJC
he PNP
had VHD
never AV0
thought VVD
that CJT

really AV0
knew VVD
her PNP

now AV0
he PNP
never AV0
would VM0
. PUN
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
little ZZ0
surprised ZZ0
how ZZ0
much ZZ0
he ZZ0
minded ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
only ZZ0
change ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
made ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
property ZZ0
was ZZ0
to ZZ0
build ZZ0
a ZZ0
garage ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
after ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
unloaded ZZ0
and ZZ0
put ZZ0
away ZZ0
the ZZ0
Jaguar ZZ0
he ZZ0
decided ZZ0
to ZZ0
climb ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
chamber ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
mill ZZ0
while ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
still ZZ0
light ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
bottom ZZ0
room ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
Its ZZ0
two ZZ0
huge ZZ0
grinding-wheels ZZ0
of ZZ0
burr-granite ZZ0
propped ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
wall ZZ0
and ZZ0
its ZZ0
lingering ZZ0
smell ZZ0
of ZZ0
flour ZZ0
, ZZ0
still ZZ0
held ZZ0
an ZZ0
air ZZ0
of ZZ0
mystery ZZ0
, ZZ0
of ZZ0
time ZZ0
held ZZ0
in ZZ0
abeyance ZZ0
, ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
place ZZ0
bereft ZZ0
of ZZ0
its ZZ0
purpose ZZ0
and ZZ0
meaning ZZ0
, ZZ0
so ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
never ZZ0
entered ZZ0
it ZZ0
without ZZ0
a ZZ0
slight ZZ0
sense ZZ0
of ZZ0
desolation ZZ0
. ZZ0
There ZZ0
were ZZ0
only ZZ0
ladders ZZ0
between ZZ0
the ZZ0
floors ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
grasped ZZ0
the ZZ0
rungs ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
saw ZZ0
again ZZ0
his ZZ0
aunt ZZ0
's ZZ0
long ZZ0
trousered ZZ0
legs ZZ0
ahead ZZ0
of ZZ0
him ZZ0
disappearing ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
chamber ZZ0
above ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0
used ZZ0
only ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
room ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
mill ZZ0
which ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
furnished ZZ0
simply ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
writing ZZ0
table ZZ0
and ZZ0
chair ZZ0
facing ZZ0
the ZZ0
North ZZ0
Sea ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
telephone ZZ0
and ZZ0
her ZZ0
binoculars ZZ0
. ZZ0
Entering ZZ0
it ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
imagine ZZ0
her ZZ0
sitting ZZ0
there ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
summer ZZ0
days ZZ0
and ZZ0
evenings ZZ0
, ZZ0
working ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
papers ZZ0
which ZZ0
she ZZ0
occasionally ZZ0
contributed ZZ0
to ZZ0
ornithological ZZ0
journals ZZ0
and ZZ0
looking ZZ0
up ZZ0
from ZZ0
time ZZ0
to ZZ0
time ZZ0
to ZZ0
gaze ZZ0
out ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
sea ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
far ZZ0
horizon ZZ0
, ZZ0
could ZZ0
see ZZ0
again ZZ0
that ZZ0
carved ZZ0
, ZZ0
weather-browned ZZ0
Aztec ZZ0
face ZZ0
with ZZ0
its ZZ0
hooded ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
under ZZ0
the ZZ0
grey-black ZZ0
hair ZZ0
, ZZ0
drawn ZZ0
back ZZ0
into ZZ0
a ZZ0
bun ZZ0
, ZZ0
could ZZ0
hear ZZ0
again ZZ0
a ZZ0
voice ZZ0
which ZZ0
, ZZ0
for ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
most ZZ0
beautiful ZZ0
female ZZ0
voices ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
ever ZZ0
heard ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
late ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
lay ZZ0
enriched ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
mellow ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
light ZZ0

wide ZZ0

blue ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0

stroke ZZ0
of ZZ0
purple ZZ0
laid ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
horizon ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
colours ZZ0
and ZZ0
shapes ZZ0
were ZZ0
intensified ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
sun ZZ0
's ZZ0
last ZZ0
strong ZZ0
rays ZZ0
so ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
ruins ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
abbey ZZ0
looked ZZ0
unreal ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
golden ZZ0
fantasy ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
blue ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sea ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
dry ZZ0
grass ZZ0
gleamed ZZ0
as ZZ0
richly ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
lush ZZ0

There ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0

at ZZ0
each ZZ0

made ZZ0
his ZZ0
slow ZZ0
perambulation ZZ0

To ZZ0
the ZZ0

could ZZ0
travel ZZ0
along ZZ0
the ZZ0
narrow ZZ0
road ZZ0
between ZZ0
the ZZ0

the ZZ0

to ZZ0
the ZZ0

Four ZZ0

moved ZZ0
again ZZ0

looked ZZ0
out ZZ0
over ZZ0

The AT0

never ZZ0

Some ZZ0

had ZZ0
exactly ZZ0
twenty ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
to ZZ0
live ZZ0

She ZZ0
sat ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
banquette ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
wall ZZ0
, ZZ0
sipping ZZ0
her ZZ0
second ZZ0
medium ZZ0
sherry ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
evening ZZ0
, ZZ0
deliberately ZZ0
making ZZ0
it ZZ0
last ZZ0
, ZZ0
knowing ZZ0
that ZZ0
Colin ZZ0
was ZZ0
impatient ZZ0
to ZZ0
order ZZ0
the ZZ0
next ZZ0
round ZZ0
. ZZ0
Catching ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
's ZZ0
eye ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
raised ZZ0
her ZZ0
left ZZ0
wrist ZZ0

nodded ZZ0
significantly ZZ0
at ZZ0
her ZZ0
watch ZZ0

Already ZZ0
, ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
ten ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
past ZZ0
their ZZ0

he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
it ZZ0

Their ZZ0
agreement ZZ0
was ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
was ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
pre-supper ZZ0

with ZZ0
Colin ZZ0

Yvonne ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
limit ZZ0
both ZZ0
of ZZ0
time ZZ0

alcohol ZZ0
consumption ZZ0
clearly ZZ0
understood ZZ0
between ZZ0
her ZZ0
and ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
before ZZ0
they ZZ0
left ZZ0
home ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
arrangement ZZ0
was ZZ0
typical ZZ0
of ZZ0
their ZZ0
nine-month-old ZZ0
marriage ZZ0
, ZZ0
sustained ZZ0
less ZZ0
by ZZ0
compatible ZZ0
interests ZZ0
than ZZ0
by ZZ0
a ZZ0
carefully ZZ0
negotiated ZZ0
series ZZ0
of ZZ0
concessions ZZ0

Tonight ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
her ZZ0

agreeing ZZ0
to ZZ0
spend ZZ0
an ZZ0
hour ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
Clarence ZZ0
with ZZ0

extend ZZ0

any ZZ0
pretence ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
actually ZZ0
enjoyed ZZ0
their ZZ0
company ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0

since ZZ0
their ZZ0
first ZZ0
meeting ZZ0
; ZZ0
the ZZ0
relationship ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
a ZZ0
glance ZZ0

had ZZ0
been ZZ0
fixed ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
stereotyped ZZ0
antagonism ZZ0
between ZZ0
newly ZZ0
acquired ZZ0
fiancee ZZ0
and ZZ0
slightly ZZ0
disreputable ZZ0
old ZZ0
schoolmate ZZ0
and ZZ0
drinking ZZ0
partner ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
best ZZ0
man ZZ0
at ZZ0
their ZZ0
wedding ZZ0
- ZZ0
a ZZ0
formidable ZZ0
pre-nuptial ZZ0
agreement ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
necessary ZZ0
for ZZ0
that ZZ0
capitulation ZZ0
- ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
carried ZZ0
out ZZ0
his ZZ0
duties ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
mixture ZZ0
of ZZ0
incompetence ZZ0
, ZZ0
vulgarity ZZ0
and ZZ0
irreverence ZZ0
which ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
occasionally ZZ0
enjoyed ZZ0
telling ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
spoilt ZZ0
for ZZ0
her ZZ0
the ZZ0
memory ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
big ZZ0
day ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
typical ZZ0
of ZZ0
him ZZ0
to ZZ0
choose ZZ0
this ZZ0
pub ZZ0
. ZZ0
God ZZ0
knew ZZ0
, ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
vulgar ZZ0
enough ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
she ZZ0
could ZZ0
be ZZ0
certain ZZ0
of ZZ0
one ZZ0
thing ZZ0
: ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
a ZZ0
place ZZ0
where ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
risk ZZ0
of ZZ0
meeting ZZ0
anyone ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
power ZZ0
station ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
not ZZ0
anyone ZZ0
who ZZ0
mattered ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
disliked ZZ0
everything ZZ0
about ZZ0
the ZZ0
Clarence ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
rough ZZ0
scrape ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
moquette ZZ0
against ZZ0
her ZZ0
legs ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
synthetic ZZ0
velvet ZZ0
which ZZ0
covered ZZ0
the ZZ0
walls ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
baskets ZZ0
of ZZ0
ivy ZZ0
spiked ZZ0
with ZZ0
artificial ZZ0
flowers ZZ0
above ZZ0
the ZZ0
bar ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
gaudiness ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
carpet ZZ0
. ZZ0
Twenty ZZ0
years ZZ0
ago ZZ0
, ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
a ZZ0
cosy ZZ0
Victorian ZZ0
hostelry ZZ0
, ZZ0
seldom ZZ0
visited ZZ0
except ZZ0
by ZZ0
its ZZ0
regulars ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
an ZZ0
open ZZ0
fire ZZ0
in ZZ0
winter ZZ0
and ZZ0
horse ZZ0
brasses ZZ0
polished ZZ0
to ZZ0
whiteness ZZ0
hung ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
black ZZ0
beams ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
lugubrious ZZ0
publican ZZ0
had ZZ0
seen ZZ0
it ZZ0
as ZZ0
his ZZ0
job ZZ0
to ZZ0
repel ZZ0
strangers ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
employed ZZ0
to ZZ0
that ZZ0
end ZZ0
an ZZ0
impressive ZZ0
armoury ZZ0
of ZZ0
taciturnity ZZ0
, ZZ0
malevolent ZZ0
glances ZZ0
, ZZ0
warm ZZ0
beer ZZ0
and ZZ0
poor ZZ0
service ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
the ZZ0
old ZZ0
pub ZZ0
had ZZ0
burnt ZZ0
down ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
1960s ZZ0
and ZZ0
been ZZ0
replaced ZZ0
by ZZ0
a ZZ0
more ZZ0
profitable ZZ0
and ZZ0
thrusting ZZ0
enterprise ZZ0
. ZZ0
Nothing ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
old ZZ0
building ZZ0
remained ZZ0

the ZZ0

and ZZ0
fruit ZZ0

with ZZ0
ice-cream ZZ0

Well ZZ0

at ZZ0

she ZZ0
had ZZ0
put ZZ0
her ZZ0
foot ZZ0
down ZZ0
over ZZ0
dinner ZZ0

They ZZ0
had ZZ0
worked ZZ0
out ZZ0
their ZZ0
monthly ZZ0

long ZZ0

She ZZ0
had ZZ0
only ZZ0
passed ZZ0
her ZZ0
driving ZZ0
test ZZ0
after ZZ0

this ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
time ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
driven ZZ0
unaccompanied ZZ0

drove ZZ0
slowly ZZ0

carefully ZZ0

her ZZ0
anxious ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
peering ZZ0
ahead ZZ0
, ZZ0
glad ZZ0
that ZZ0
at ZZ0

the ZZ0
route ZZ0
home ZZ0
was ZZ0
familiar ZZ0

She ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
what ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
would ZZ0
do ZZ0
when ZZ0
he ZZ0
saw ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
had ZZ0
gone ZZ0
. ZZ0
Almost ZZ0
certainly ZZ0
he ZZ0
would ZZ0
expect ZZ0
to ZZ0
find ZZ0
her ZZ0
sitting ZZ0
there ZZ0
, ZZ0
fuming ZZ0
but ZZ0
ready ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
driven ZZ0
home ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
he ZZ0
'd ZZ0
have ZZ0
to ZZ0
rely ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
lift ZZ0
on ZZ0
Colin ZZ0
who ZZ0
would ZZ0
n't ZZ0
be ZZ0
so ZZ0
keen ZZ0
on ZZ0
coming ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
way ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
if ZZ0
they ZZ0
thought ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
going ZZ0
to ZZ0
invite ZZ0
Colin ZZ0
and ZZ0
Yvonne ZZ0
in ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
drink ZZ0
when ZZ0
they ZZ0
arrived ZZ0
they ZZ0
would ZZ0
get ZZ0
a ZZ0
shock ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
thought ZZ0
of ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
's ZZ0
discomfiture ZZ0
at ZZ0
finding ZZ0
her ZZ0
gone ZZ0
cheered ZZ0
her ZZ0
a ZZ0
little ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
pressed ZZ0
her ZZ0
foot ZZ0
down ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
accelerator ZZ0
, ZZ0
anxious ZZ0
to ZZ0
distance ZZ0
herself ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
three ZZ0
of ZZ0
them ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
reach ZZ0
the ZZ0
safety ZZ0
of ZZ0
home ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
gave ZZ0
a ZZ0
stutter ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
engine ZZ0
died ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
must ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
driving ZZ0
more ZZ0
erratically ZZ0
than ZZ0
she ZZ0
thought ZZ0
for ZZ0
she ZZ0
found ZZ0
herself ZZ0
half ZZ0
skewed ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
road ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
bad ZZ0
place ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
stranded ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
lonely ZZ0
stretch ZZ0
of ZZ0
country ZZ0
lane ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
thin ZZ0
band ZZ0
of ZZ0
trees ZZ0
on ZZ0
either ZZ0
side ZZ0
and ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
deserted ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
then ZZ0
she ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
. ZZ0
Norman ZZ0
had ZZ0
mentioned ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
needed ZZ0
to ZZ0
fill ZZ0
up ZZ0
with ZZ0
petrol ZZ0
and ZZ0
must ZZ0
be ZZ0
sure ZZ0
to ZZ0
call ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
all-night ZZ0
garage ZZ0
after ZZ0
they ZZ0
left ZZ0
the ZZ0
Clarence ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
ridiculous ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
let ZZ0
the ZZ0
tank ZZ0
get ZZ0
so ZZ0
low ZZ0
but ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
had ZZ0
an ZZ0
argument ZZ0
only ZZ0
three ZZ0
days ZZ0
earlier ZZ0
on ZZ0
whose ZZ0
turn ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
to ZZ0
call ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
garage ZZ0
and ZZ0
pay ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
petrol ZZ0
. ZZ0
All ZZ0
her ZZ0
anger ZZ0
and ZZ0
frustration ZZ0
returned ZZ0
. ZZ0
For ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
she ZZ0
sat ZZ0
there ZZ0
, ZZ0
beating ZZ0
her ZZ0
hands ZZ0
impotently ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
wheel ZZ0
, ZZ0
desperately ZZ0
turning ZZ0
the ZZ0
key ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
ignition ZZ0
, ZZ0
willing ZZ0
the ZZ0
engine ZZ0
to ZZ0
start ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
no ZZ0
response ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
then ZZ0
irritation ZZ0
began ZZ0
to ZZ0
give ZZ0
way ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
tricklings ZZ0
of ZZ0
fear ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
road ZZ0
was ZZ0
deserted ZZ0
and ZZ0
even ZZ0
if ZZ0
a ZZ0
motorist ZZ0
came ZZ0
by ZZ0
and ZZ0
drew ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
could ZZ0
she ZZ0
be ZZ0
certain ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
a ZZ0
kidnapper ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
rapist ZZ0
, ZZ0
even ZZ0
the ZZ0
Whistler ZZ0
? ZZ0
There ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
that ZZ0
horrible ZZ0
murder ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
A3 ZZ0
only ZZ0
this ZZ0
year ZZ0
. ZZ0
Nowadays ZZ0
you ZZ0
could ZZ0
trust ZZ0
no ZZ0
one ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
she ZZ0
could ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
leave ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
where ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
slewed ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
road ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
tried ZZ0
to ZZ0
recall ZZ0
when ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
last ZZ0
passed ZZ0
a ZZ0
house ZZ0
, ZZ0
an ZZ0
AA ZZ0
box ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
public ZZ0
telephone ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
it ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
driving ZZ0
through ZZ0
deserted ZZ0
countryside ZZ0
for ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
ten ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
. ZZ0
Even ZZ0
if ZZ0
she ZZ0
left ZZ0
the ZZ0
dubious ZZ0
sanctuary ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
no ZZ0
clue ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
best ZZ0
direction ZZ0
in ZZ0
which ZZ0
to ZZ0
seek ZZ0
help ZZ0
. ZZ0
Suddenly ZZ0
a ZZ0
wave ZZ0
of ZZ0
total ZZ0
panic ZZ0
swept ZZ0
across ZZ0
her ZZ0
like ZZ0
nausea ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
to ZZ0
resist ZZ0
the ZZ0
urge ZZ0
to ZZ0
dash ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
and ZZ0
hide ZZ0
herself ZZ0
among ZZ0
the ZZ0
trees ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
what ZZ0
good ZZ0
would ZZ0
that ZZ0
do ZZ0
? ZZ0
He ZZ0
might ZZ0
be ZZ0
lurking ZZ0
even ZZ0
there ZZ0
. ZZ0
An ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
miraculously ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
heard ZZ0
footsteps ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
looking ZZ0
round ZZ0
, ZZ0
saw ZZ0
a ZZ0
woman ZZ0
approaching ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
was ZZ0
dressed ZZ0
in ZZ0
trousers ZZ0
and ZZ0
a ZZ0
trenchcoat ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
mane ZZ0
of ZZ0
fair ZZ0
hair ZZ0
beneath ZZ0
a ZZ0
tight-fitting ZZ0
beret ZZ0
. ZZ0
At ZZ0
her ZZ0
side ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
leash ZZ0
trotted ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
, ZZ0
smooth-haired ZZ0
dog ZZ0
. ZZ0
Immediately ZZ0
all ZZ0
her ZZ0
anxiety ZZ0
vanished ZZ0
. ZZ0
Here ZZ0
was ZZ0
someone ZZ0
who ZZ0
would ZZ0
help ZZ0
her ZZ0
push ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
road ZZ0
, ZZ0
who ZZ0
would ZZ0
know ZZ0
in ZZ0
which ZZ0
direction ZZ0
lay ZZ0
the ZZ0
nearest ZZ0
house ZZ0
, ZZ0
who ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
companion ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
walk ZZ0
. ZZ0
Without ZZ0
even ZZ0
troubling ZZ0
to ZZ0
slam ZZ0
the ZZ0
door ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
car ZZ0
she ZZ0
called ZZ0
out ZZ0
happily ZZ0
and ZZ0
ran ZZ0
smiling ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
horror ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
death ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
dinner ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
excellent ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
wine ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
Château ZZ0
Potensac ZZ0
'78 ZZ0
, ZZ0
an ZZ0
interesting ZZ0
choice ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
main ZZ0
course ZZ0
. ZZ0
Although ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
knew ZZ0
of ZZ0
Alice ZZ0
Mair ZZ0
's ZZ0
reputation ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
cookery ZZ0
writer ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
never ZZ0
read ZZ0
any ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
books ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
no ZZ0
idea ZZ0
to ZZ0
what ZZ0
culinary ZZ0
school ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
any ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
belonged ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
feared ZZ0
being ZZ0
presented ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
usual ZZ0
artistic ZZ0
creation ZZ0
swimming ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
pool ZZ0
of ZZ0
sauce ZZ0
and ZZ0
accompanied ZZ0
by ZZ0
one ZZ0
or ZZ0
two ZZ0
undercooked ZZ0
carrots ZZ0
and ZZ0
mange-tout ZZ0
elegantly ZZ0
arranged ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
side ZZ0
plate ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
the ZZ0
wild ZZ0
ducks ZZ0
carved ZZ0
by ZZ0
Alex ZZ0
Mair ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
recognizably ZZ0
ducks ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
piquant ZZ0
sauce ZZ0
, ZZ0
new ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
enhanced ZZ0
rather ZZ0
than ZZ0
dominated ZZ0
the ZZ0
taste ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
birds ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
small ZZ0
mounds ZZ0
of ZZ0
creamed ZZ0
turnip ZZ0
and ZZ0
parsnip ZZ0
were ZZ0
an ZZ0
agreeable ZZ0
addition ZZ0
to ZZ0
green ZZ0
peas ZZ0
. ZZ0
Afterwards ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
eaten ZZ0
orange ZZ0
sorbet ZZ0
followed ZZ0
by ZZ0
cheese ZZ0
and ZZ0
fruit ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
conventional ZZ0
menu ZZ0
but ZZ0
one ZZ0
intended ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
felt ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
please ZZ0
the ZZ0
guests ZZ0
rather ZZ0
than ZZ0
to ZZ0
demonstrate ZZ0
the ZZ0
ingenuity ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
cook ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
expected ZZ0
fourth ZZ0
guest ZZ0
, ZZ0
Miles ZZ0
Lessingham ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
unaccountably ZZ0
failed ZZ0
to ZZ0
arrive ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
Alice ZZ0
Mair ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
rearranged ZZ0
her ZZ0
table ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
empty ZZ0
chair ZZ0
and ZZ0
unfilled ZZ0
wineglass ZZ0
were ZZ0
uncomfortably ZZ0
evocative ZZ0
of ZZ0
Banquo ZZ0
's ZZ0
ghost ZZ0
. ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
was ZZ0
seated ZZ0
opposite ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
Robarts ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
portrait ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
thought ZZ0
, ZZ0
must ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
even ZZ0
more ZZ0
powerful ZZ0
than ZZ0
he ZZ0
realized ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
could ZZ0
so ZZ0
dominate ZZ0
his ZZ0
physical ZZ0
reaction ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
living ZZ0
woman ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
time ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
met ZZ0
although ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
known ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
existence ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
of ZZ0
all ZZ0
the ZZ0
handful ZZ0
of ZZ0
people ZZ0
who ZZ0
lived ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
the ZZ0
Lydsett ZZ0
villagers ZZ0
said ZZ0
, ZZ0
" ZZ0
t' ZZ0
other ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
gate ZZ0
" ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
little ZZ0
strange ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
was ZZ0
their ZZ0
first ZZ0
meeting ZZ0
; ZZ0
her ZZ0
red ZZ0
Golf ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
frequent ZZ0
sight ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
, ZZ0
her ZZ0
cottage ZZ0
had ZZ0
frequently ZZ0
met ZZ0
Iris ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
top ZZ0
storey ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
mill ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
, ZZ0
physically ZZ0
close ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
time ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
found ZZ0
it ZZ0
difficult ZZ0
to ZZ0
keep ZZ0
his ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
off ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
living ZZ0
flesh ZZ0
and ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
image ZZ0
seeming ZZ0
to ZZ0
fuse ZZ0
into ZZ0
a ZZ0
presence ZZ0
both ZZ0
potent ZZ0
and ZZ0
disturbing ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
handsome ZZ0
face ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
model ZZ0
's ZZ0
face ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
thought ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
its ZZ0
high ZZ0
cheekbones ZZ0
, ZZ0
long ZZ0
, ZZ0
slightly ZZ0
concave ZZ0
nose ZZ0
, ZZ0
wide ZZ0
, ZZ0
full ZZ0
lips ZZ0
and ZZ0
dark ZZ0
, ZZ0
angry ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
deeply ZZ0
set ZZ0
under ZZ0
the ZZ0
strong ZZ0
brows ZZ0
. ZZ0
Her ZZ0
crimped ZZ0
, ZZ0
springing ZZ0
hair ZZ0
, ZZ0
held ZZ0
back ZZ0
with ZZ0
two ZZ0
combs ZZ0
, ZZ0
fell ZZ0
over ZZ0
her ZZ0
shoulders ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
could ZZ0
imagine ZZ0
her ZZ0
posed ZZ0
, ZZ0
mouth ZZ0
moistly ZZ0
open ZZ0
, ZZ0
hips ZZ0
jutting ZZ0
and ZZ0
staring ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
cameras ZZ0
with ZZ0
that ZZ0
apparently ZZ0
obligatory ZZ0
look ZZ0
of ZZ0
arrogant ZZ0
resentment ZZ0
. ZZ0
As ZZ0
she ZZ0
leaned ZZ0
forward ZZ0
to ZZ0
twitch ZZ0
another ZZ0
grape ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
bunch ZZ0
and ZZ0
almost ZZ0
toss ZZ0
it ZZ0
into ZZ0
her ZZ0
mouth ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
see ZZ0
the ZZ0
faint ZZ0
freckles ZZ0
which ZZ0
smudged ZZ0
the ZZ0
dark ZZ0
forehead ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
glisten ZZ0
of ZZ0
hairs ZZ0
above ZZ0
a ZZ0
carved ZZ0
upper ZZ0
lip ZZ0
. ZZ0
On ZZ0
the ZZ0
other ZZ0
side ZZ0
of ZZ0
their ZZ0
host ZZ0
sat ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
Dennison ZZ0
, ZZ0
delicately ZZ0
but ZZ0
unfussily ZZ0
peeling ZZ0
her ZZ0
grapes ZZ0
with ZZ0
pink-tipped ZZ0
fingers ZZ0
. ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
Robarts ZZ0
's ZZ0
sultry ZZ0
handsomeness ZZ0
emphasized ZZ0
her ZZ0
own ZZ0
very ZZ0
different ZZ0
look ZZ0
, ZZ0
an ZZ0
old-fashioned ZZ0
, ZZ0
carefully ZZ0
tended ZZ0
but ZZ0
unselfconscious ZZ0
prettiness ZZ0
which ZZ0
reminded ZZ0
him ZZ0
of ZZ0
photographs ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
late ZZ0
thirties ZZ0
. ZZ0
Their ZZ0
clothes ZZ0
emphasized ZZ0
the ZZ0
contrast ZZ0
. ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
wore ZZ0
a ZZ0
shirtwaister ZZ0
dress ZZ0
in ZZ0
multicoloured ZZ0
Indian ZZ0
cotton ZZ0
, ZZ0
three ZZ0
buttons ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
neck ZZ0
undone ZZ0
. ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
Dennison ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
long ZZ0
black ZZ0
skirt ZZ0
and ZZ0
a ZZ0
blue ZZ0
patterned ZZ0
silk ZZ0
blouse ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
bow ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
neck ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
their ZZ0
hostess ZZ0
who ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
most ZZ0
elegant ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
long ZZ0
shift ZZ0
in ZZ0
fine ZZ0
dark ZZ0
brown ZZ0
wool ZZ0
worn ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
heavy ZZ0
necklace ZZ0
of ZZ0
silver ZZ0
and ZZ0
amber ZZ0
hid ZZ0
her ZZ0
angularity ZZ0
and ZZ0
emphasized ZZ0
the ZZ0
strength ZZ0
and ZZ0
regularity ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
strong ZZ0
features ZZ0
. ZZ0
Beside ZZ0
her ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
Dennison ZZ0
's ZZ0
prettiness ZZ0
was ZZ0
diminished ZZ0
almost ZZ0
to ZZ0
insipidity ZZ0
and ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
Robarts ZZ0
's ZZ0
strong-coloured ZZ0
cotton ZZ0
looked ZZ0
tawdry ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
room ZZ0
in ZZ0
which ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
dining ZZ0
must ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
thought ZZ0
, ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
part ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
original ZZ0
cottage ZZ0
. ZZ0
From ZZ0
these ZZ0
smoke-blackened ZZ0
beams ZZ0
Agnes ZZ0
Poley ZZ0
had ZZ0
hung ZZ0
her ZZ0
sides ZZ0
of ZZ0
bacon ZZ0
, ZZ0
her ZZ0
bundles ZZ0
of ZZ0
dried ZZ0
herbs ZZ0
. ZZ0
In ZZ0
a ZZ0
pot ZZ0
slung ZZ0
over ZZ0
that ZZ0
huge ZZ0
hearth ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
cooked ZZ0
her ZZ0
family ZZ0
's ZZ0
meals ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
perhaps ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
end ZZ0
had ZZ0
heard ZZ0
in ZZ0
its ZZ0
roaring ZZ0
flames ZZ0
the ZZ0
crackling ZZ0
faggots ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
dreadful ZZ0
martyrdom ZZ0
. ZZ0
Outside ZZ0
the ZZ0
long ZZ0
window ZZ0
had ZZ0
passed ZZ0
the ZZ0
helmets ZZ0
of ZZ0
marching ZZ0
men ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
only ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
name ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
cottage ZZ0
was ZZ0
there ZZ0
a ZZ0
memory ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
past ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
oval ZZ0
dining ZZ0
table ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
chairs ZZ0
were ZZ0
modern ZZ0
as ZZ0
were ZZ0
the ZZ0
Wedgwood ZZ0
dinner ZZ0
service ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
elegant ZZ0
glasses ZZ0
. ZZ0
In ZZ0
the ZZ0
drawing ZZ0
room ZZ0
, ZZ0
where ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
drunk ZZ0
their ZZ0
pre-dinner ZZ0
sherry ZZ0
, ZZ0
Dalgliesh ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
sense ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
room ZZ0
which ZZ0
deliberately ZZ0
rejected ZZ0
the ZZ0
past ZZ0
, ZZ0
containing ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
which ZZ0
could ZZ0
violate ZZ0
the ZZ0
owner ZZ0
's ZZ0
essential ZZ0

; ZZ0
no ZZ0

out ZZ0
of ZZ0

sentimentality ZZ0
or ZZ0
family ZZ0

, ZZ0
no ZZ0

collected ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0

. ZZ0
Even ZZ0
the ZZ0
few ZZ0
pictures ZZ0
, ZZ0
three ZZ0
recognizably ZZ0
by ZZ0
John ZZ0
Piper ZZ0
, ZZ0
were ZZ0
modern ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
furniture ZZ0
was ZZ0
expensive ZZ0
, ZZ0
comfortable ZZ0
, ZZ0
well ZZ0
heart ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
cottage ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
there ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0
that ZZ0
large ZZ0
, ZZ0
warm-smelling ZZ0
and ZZ0
welcoming ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
only ZZ0
been ZZ0
half ZZ0
listening ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
conversation ZZ0
but ZZ0
now ZZ0
he ZZ0
forced ZZ0
himself ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
more ZZ0
accommodating ZZ0
guest ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
talk ZZ0
was ZZ0
general ZZ0
, ZZ0
candlelit ZZ0
faces ZZ0
leaned ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
table ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
hands ZZ0
which ZZ0
peeled ZZ0
the ZZ0
fruit ZZ0
or ZZ0
fidgeted ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0

saying ZZ0

" ZZ0
All DT0

We ZZ0
know ZZ0

can ZZ0
use ZZ0
human ZZ0
tissue ZZ0
from ZZ0
aborted ZZ0

treat ZZ0
Parkinson ZZ0

disease ZZ0
and ZZ0
probably ZZ0
Alzheimer ZZ0

Presumably ZZ0
you ZZ0
'd ZZ0
find ZZ0
that ZZ0
ethically ZZ0
acceptable ZZ0
if ZZ0
the ZZ0
abortion ZZ0
were ZZ0
natural ZZ0

legal ZZ0

not ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
were ZZ0
induced ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0

you ZZ0

pausing ZZ0
at ZZ0

take ZZ0
gulps ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0

It ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0

he ZZ0
was ZZ0
subtly ZZ0
altered ZZ0
since ZZ0

had ZZ0
become ZZ0
charged ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
power ZZ0
both ZZ0
mysterious ZZ0
and ZZ0
oddly ZZ0
familiar ZZ0

He ZZ0
thought ZZ0
: ZZ0
He ZZ0
has ZZ0
acquired ZZ0
the ZZ0
mystique ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
story-teller ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
glancing ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
ring ZZ0
of ZZ0
fire-lit ZZ0
and ZZ0
intent ZZ0
faces ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0
reminded ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
first ZZ0
village ZZ0
school ZZ0
, ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0

clustered ZZ0
round ZZ0
Miss ZZ0
Douglas ZZ0

three ZZ0
o'clock ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
Friday ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
half ZZ0
hour ZZ0
of ZZ0
story-time ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
felt ZZ0
a ZZ0
pang ZZ0
of ZZ0
pain ZZ0
and ZZ0
regret ZZ0
for ZZ0
those ZZ0
lost ZZ0
days ZZ0
of ZZ0
innocence ZZ0
and ZZ0
love ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
surprised ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
memory ZZ0
should ZZ0
have ZZ0
come ZZ0
back ZZ0
so ZZ0
keenly ZZ0
and ZZ0
at ZZ0
such ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
this ZZ0
was ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
a ZZ0
very ZZ0
different ZZ0
story ZZ0

one ZZ0
unsuited ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
ears ZZ0

Lessingham ZZ0
said ZZ0
: ZZ0
" ZZ0
I ZZ0
had ZZ0
an ZZ0
appointment ZZ0
with ZZ0

dentist ZZ0
in ZZ0

five ZZ0
o'clock ZZ0

then ZZ0
briefly ZZ0
visited ZZ0
a ZZ0
friend ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
Close ZZ0

So ZZ0
I ZZ0
drove ZZ0
here ZZ0
from ZZ0
Norwich ZZ0
, ZZ0
not ZZ0
from ZZ0
my ZZ0
cottage ZZ0

I ZZ0
'd ZZ0
just ZZ0
turned ZZ0
right ZZ0
off ZZ0
the ZZ0
B1 ZZ0
150 ZZ0
at ZZ0
Fairstead ZZ0
when ZZ0
I ZZ0
nearly ZZ0
crashed ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
back ZZ0
of ZZ0
this ZZ0
unlit ZZ0
car ZZ0
skewed ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
road ZZ0
. ZZ0
I ZZ0
thought ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
damn ZZ0
silly ZZ0
place ZZ0
to ZZ0
park ZZ0
if ZZ0
someone ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
to ZZ0
take ZZ0
a ZZ0
leak ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
bushes ZZ0
. ZZ0
Then ZZ0
it ZZ0
crossed ZZ0
my ZZ0
mind ZZ0
that ZZ0
there ZZ0
could ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
an ZZ0
accident ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
the ZZ0
right-hand ZZ0
door ZZ0
was ZZ0
open ZZ0

seemed ZZ0
a ZZ0
bit ZZ0
odd ZZ0

I ZZ0
drew ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
side ZZ0

went ZZ0
to ZZ0
take ZZ0
a ZZ0
look ZZ0

There ZZ0
was ZZ0
no ZZ0
one ZZ0
about ZZ0

I ZZ0
'm ZZ0
not ZZ0

why ZZ0
I ZZ0

It ZZ0

dark ZZ0

I ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
whether ZZ0

Then ZZ0
I ZZ0
felt ZZ0
a ZZ0
fool ZZ0
and ZZ0
decided ZZ0
to ZZ0
leave ZZ0
it ZZ0
and ZZ0
mind ZZ0
my ZZ0
own ZZ0
business ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
then ZZ0
that ZZ0
I ZZ0
almost ZZ0
tripped ZZ0
over ZZ0

it ZZ0

I ZZ0

touched ZZ0
her ZZ0

sure ZZ0

flesh ZZ0
, ZZ0
even ZZ0

I ZZ0
went ZZ0

my ZZ0

up ZZ0

He ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
why ZZ0

he ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
question ZZ0
his ZZ0

The ZZ0
allegation ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
spoken ZZ0
so ZZ0
quietly ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
doubted ZZ0
whether ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
in ZZ0

heard ZZ0
it ZZ0

he ZZ0
asked ZZ0

The ZZ0
question ZZ0
did ZZ0
not ZZ0
appear ZZ0
to ZZ0
surprise ZZ0
her ZZ0

it ZZ0
did ZZ0
surprise ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0

the ZZ0
very ZZ0
fact ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
walking ZZ0

companionably ZZ0
together ZZ0

She ZZ0

curiously ZZ0

liked ZZ0
her ZZ0
quiet ZZ0
gentleness ZZ0
with ZZ0
its ZZ0
suggestion ZZ0
of ZZ0
underlying ZZ0
strength ZZ0

Her DPS

And ZZ0
he ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
whether ZZ0

in ZZ0
such ZZ0
a ZZ0
disorientating ZZ0

of ZZ0

listening ZZ0

that ZZ0
the ZZ0

Suddenly AV0
his DPS

stopped VVN-VVD

And ZZ0
there ZZ0

a ZZ0

And ZZ0
when ZZ0
, ZZ0
five ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
later ZZ0
, ZZ0
they ZZ0
made ZZ0
their ZZ0
way ZZ0
cautiously ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
humpy ZZ0
grass ZZ0
into ZZ0
the ZZ0
heart ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0

there ZZ0
was ZZ0
no ZZ0
one ZZ0
and ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
to ZZ0

Without ZZ0
speaking ZZ0
they ZZ0
walked ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0
gap ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
east ZZ0
window ZZ0
and ZZ0
on ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
edge ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
cliff ZZ0
and ZZ0
saw ZZ0
only ZZ0
the ZZ0
moon-bleached ZZ0

stretching ZZ0
north ZZ0

south ZZ0

the ZZ0
thin ZZ0
fringe ZZ0

If ZZ0
anyone ZZ0

no ZZ0

" ZZ0
By ZZ0
four ZZ0
o'clock ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
morning ZZ0
, ZZ0
when ZZ0
Alice ZZ0
Mair ZZ0
woke ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
despairing ZZ0
cry ZZ0
from ZZ0
her ZZ0
nightmare ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
wind ZZ0
was ZZ0
rising ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
stretched ZZ0
out ZZ0
her ZZ0
hand ZZ0
to ZZ0
click ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
bedside ZZ0
light ZZ0
, ZZ0
checked ZZ0
her ZZ0
watch ZZ0
, ZZ0
then ZZ0
lay ZZ0
back ZZ0
, ZZ0
panic ZZ0
subsiding ZZ0
, ZZ0
her ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
staring ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
ceiling ZZ0
while ZZ0
the ZZ0
terrible ZZ0
immediacy ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
dream ZZ0
began ZZ0
to ZZ0
fade ZZ0
, ZZ0
recognized ZZ0
for ZZ0
what ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
an ZZ0
old ZZ0
spectre ZZ0
returning ZZ0
after ZZ0
all ZZ0
these ZZ0
years ZZ0
, ZZ0
conjured ZZ0
up ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
events ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
night ZZ0
and ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
reiteration ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
word ZZ0
" ZZ0
murder ZZ0
" ZZ0
which ZZ0
, ZZ0
since ZZ0
the ZZ0
Whistler ZZ0
had ZZ0
begun ZZ0
Iris ZZ0
work ZZ0
, ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
murmur ZZ0
sonorously ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
very ZZ0
air ZZ0
. ZZ0
Gradually ZZ0
she ZZ0
reentered ZZ0
the ZZ0
real ZZ0
world ZZ0
, ZZ0
manifested ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
small ZZ0
noises ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
night ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
moan ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
wind ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
chimneys ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
smoothness ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sheet ZZ0
in ZZ0
her ZZ0
clutching ZZ0
hands ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
unnaturally ZZ0
loud ZZ0
ticking ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
watch ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
above ZZ0
all ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
that ZZ0
oblong ZZ0
of ZZ0
pale ZZ0
light ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
open ZZ0
casement ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
drawn ZZ0
curtains ZZ0
which ZZ0
gave ZZ0
her ZZ0
a ZZ0
view ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
faintly ZZ0
luminous ZZ0
star-studded ZZ0
sky ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
nightmare ZZ0
needed ZZ0
no ZZ0
interpretation ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
merely ZZ0
a ZZ0
new ZZ0
version ZZ0
of ZZ0
an ZZ0
old ZZ0
horror ZZ0
, ZZ0
less ZZ0
tenable ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
dreams ZZ0
of ZZ0
childhood ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
more ZZ0
rational ZZ0
, ZZ0
more ZZ0
adult ZZ0
terror ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
and ZZ0
Alex ZZ0
were ZZ0
children ZZ0
again ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
whole ZZ0
family ZZ0
living ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
Copleys ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0
. ZZ0
That ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
dream ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
so ZZ0
surprising ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0
was ZZ0
only ZZ0
a ZZ0
larger ZZ0
, ZZ0
less ZZ0
pretentious ZZ0
version ZZ0
of ZZ0
Sunnybank ZZ0
- ZZ0
ridiculously ZZ0
named ZZ0
since ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
stood ZZ0
on ZZ0
level ZZ0
ground ZZ0
and ZZ0
no ZZ0
sun ZZ0
ever ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
penetrate ZZ0
its ZZ0
windows ZZ0
. ZZ0
Both ZZ0
were ZZ0
late ZZ0
Victorian ZZ0
, ZZ0
built ZZ0
in ZZ0
solid ZZ0
red ZZ0
brick ZZ0
, ZZ0
both ZZ0
had ZZ0
a ZZ0
strong ZZ0
, ZZ0
curved ZZ0
door ZZ0
under ZZ0
a ZZ0
high ZZ0
, ZZ0
peaked ZZ0
porch ZZ0
, ZZ0
both ZZ0
were ZZ0
isolated ZZ0
, ZZ0
each ZZ0
in ZZ0
its ZZ0
own ZZ0
garden ZZ0
. ZZ0
In ZZ0
the ZZ0
dream ZZ0
she ZZ0
and ZZ0
her ZZ0
father ZZ0
were ZZ0
walking ZZ0
together ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0
shrubbery ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
carrying ZZ0
his ZZ0
billhook ZZ0
and ZZ0
was ZZ0
dressed ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
on ZZ0
that ZZ0
last ZZ0
dreadful ZZ0
autumn ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
singlet ZZ0
stained ZZ0
with ZZ0
his ZZ0
sweat ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
shorts ZZ0
high ZZ0
cut ZZ0
, ZZ0
showing ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
walked ZZ0
the ZZ0
bulge ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
scrotum ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
white ZZ0
legs ZZ0
, ZZ0
matted ZZ0
with ZZ0
black ZZ0
hair ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
knees ZZ0
down ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
was ZZ0
worried ZZ0
because ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
Copleys ZZ0
were ZZ0
waiting ZZ0
for ZZ0
her ZZ0
to ZZ0
cook ZZ0
lunch ZZ0
. ZZ0
Mr ZZ0
Copley ZZ0
, ZZ0
robed ZZ0
in ZZ0
cassock ZZ0
and ZZ0
billowing ZZ0
surplice ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
impatiently ZZ0
pacing ZZ0
the ZZ0
back ZZ0
lawn ZZ0
seeming ZZ0
oblivious ZZ0
to ZZ0
their ZZ0
presence ZZ0
. ZZ0
Her ZZ0
father ZZ0
was ZZ0
explaining ZZ0
something ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
in ZZ0
that ZZ0
overloud ZZ0
, ZZ0
careful ZZ0
voice ZZ0
which ZZ0
he ZZ0
used ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
mother ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
voice ZZ0
which ZZ0
said ZZ0
: ZZ0
" ZZ0
I PNP

too AV0
stupid AJ0

. ZZ0
" ZZ0
And ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
spoke ZZ0
he ZZ0
swung ZZ0
the ZZ0
billhook ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
saw ZZ0
that ZZ0
its ZZ0
tip ZZ0
was ZZ0
red ZZ0
with ZZ0
blood ZZ0
. ZZ0
Then ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0
he ZZ0
turned ZZ0
towards ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
blazing ZZ0
, ZZ0
lifted ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
felt ZZ0
its ZZ0
point ZZ0
pierce ZZ0
the ZZ0
skin ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
forehead ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
sudden ZZ0
spurt ZZ0
of ZZ0
blood ZZ0
gushing ZZ0
into ZZ0
her ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
wide ZZ0
awake ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
breathing ZZ0
as ZZ0
if ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
running ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
put ZZ0
her ZZ0
hand ZZ0
up ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
brow ZZ0
and ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
cold ZZ0
wetness ZZ0
she ZZ0
felt ZZ0
was ZZ0
sweat ZZ0
not ZZ0
blood ZZ0
. ZZ0
There ZZ0
was ZZ0
little ZZ0
hope ZZ0
of ZZ0
falling ZZ0
asleep ZZ0
again ZZ0
; ZZ0
there ZZ0
never ZZ0
was ZZ0
when ZZ0
she ZZ0
woke ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
early ZZ0
hours ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
could ZZ0
get ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
put ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
dressing ZZ0
gown ZZ0
, ZZ0
go ZZ0
downstairs ZZ0
and ZZ0
make ZZ0
tea ZZ0
, ZZ0
correct ZZ0
her ZZ0
proofs ZZ0
, ZZ0
read ZZ0
, ZZ0
listen ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
BBC ZZ0
World ZZ0
Service ZZ0
. ZZ0
Or ZZ0
she ZZ0
could ZZ0
take ZZ0
one ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
sleeping ZZ0
tablets ZZ0
. ZZ0
God ZZ0
knew ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
powerful ZZ0
enough ZZ0
to ZZ0
knock ZZ0
her ZZ0
into ZZ0
oblivion ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
trying ZZ0
to ZZ0
wean ZZ0
herself ZZ0
off ZZ0
them ZZ0
and ZZ0
to ZZ0
give ZZ0
in ZZ0
now ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
to ZZ0
acknowledge ZZ0
the ZZ0
potency ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
nightmare ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
would ZZ0
get ZZ0
up ZZ0
and ZZ0
make ZZ0
tea ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0
no ZZ0
fear ZZ0
of ZZ0
waking ZZ0
Alex ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
slept ZZ0
soundly ZZ0
, ZZ0
even ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0
winter ZZ0
gales ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
first ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
small ZZ0
act ZZ0
of ZZ0
exorcism ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
performed ZZ0
. ZZ0
If ZZ0
the ZZ0
dream ZZ0
were ZZ0
to ZZ0
lose ZZ0
its ZZ0
power ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
she ZZ0
were ZZ0
somehow ZZ0
to ZZ0
prevent ZZ0
it ZZ0
recurring ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
must ZZ0
face ZZ0
again ZZ0
the ZZ0
memory ZZ0
of ZZ0
that ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
nearly ZZ0
thirty ZZ0
years ZZ0
ago ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
a ZZ0
warm ZZ0
autumnal ZZ0
day ZZ0
in ZZ0
early ZZ0
October ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
, ZZ0
Alex ZZ0
and ZZ0
her ZZ0
father ZZ0
were ZZ0
working ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
garden ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
was ZZ0
Wearing ZZ0
a ZZ0
thick ZZ0
hedge ZZ0
of ZZ0
brambles ZZ0
and ZZ0
overgrown ZZ0
shrubs ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
bottom ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
shrubbery ZZ0
and ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
sight ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
house ZZ0
, ZZ0
slashing ZZ0
at ZZ0
them ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
billhook ZZ0
while ZZ0
Alex ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
dragged ZZ0
the ZZ0
freed ZZ0
branches ZZ0
clear ZZ0
ready ZZ0
to ZZ0
build ZZ0
a ZZ0
bonfire ZZ0
. ZZ0
Her ZZ0
father ZZ0
was ZZ0
under ZZ0
clad ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
time ZZ0
of ZZ0
year ZZ0
but ZZ0
was ZZ0
sweating ZZ0
heavily ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
saw ZZ0
the ZZ0
arm ZZ0
lifting ZZ0
and ZZ0
falling ZZ0
, ZZ0
heard ZZ0
the ZZ0
crack ZZ0
of ZZ0
twigs ZZ0
, ZZ0
felt ZZ0
again ZZ0
the ZZ0
thorns ZZ0
cutting ZZ0
her ZZ0
fingers ZZ0
, ZZ0
heard ZZ0
his ZZ0
high ZZ0
commands ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
gave ZZ0
a ZZ0
cry ZZ0
. ZZ0
Either ZZ0
the ZZ0
branch ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
rotten ZZ0
or ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
missed ZZ0
his ZZ0
aim ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
billhook ZZ0
had ZZ0
sliced ZZ0
into ZZ0
his ZZ0
naked ZZ0
thigh ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
turning ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
saw ZZ0
the ZZ0
great ZZ0
curve ZZ0
of ZZ0
red ZZ0
blood ZZ0
begin ZZ0
to ZZ0
bubble ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
air ZZ0
, ZZ0
saw ZZ0
him ZZ0
slowly ZZ0
sink ZZ0
like ZZ0
a ZZ0
wounded ZZ0
animal ZZ0
, ZZ0
his ZZ0
hands ZZ0
plucking ZZ0
the ZZ0
air ZZ0
. ZZ0
His ZZ0
right ZZ0
hand ZZ0
dropped ZZ0
the ZZ0
billhook ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
held ZZ0
it ZZ0
out ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
shaking ZZ0
, ZZ0
palm ZZ0
upward ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
looked ZZ0
at ZZ0
her ZZ0
beseechingly ZZ0
, ZZ0
like ZZ0
a ZZ0
child ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
tried ZZ0
to ZZ0
speak ZZ0
but ZZ0
she ZZ0
could ZZ0
n't ZZ0
make ZZ0
out ZZ0
the ZZ0
words ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
was ZZ0
moving ZZ0
towards ZZ0
him ZZ0
, ZZ0
fascinated ZZ0
, ZZ0
when ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0
she ZZ0
felt ZZ0
a ZZ0
clutch ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
arm ZZ0
laurels ZZ0
towards ZZ0
the ZZ0
orchard ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
cried ZZ0
: ZZ0

remember ZZ0
whether ZZ0

actually ZZ0
said ZZ0
the ZZ0

. ZZ0
All ZZ0
she ZZ0
later ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
strength ZZ0
of ZZ0
his ZZ0
hands ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
shoulders ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
forced ZZ0
her ZZ0
back ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
bark ZZ0
of ZZ0
an ZZ0
apple ZZ0
tree ZZ0
and ZZ0
held ZZ0
her ZZ0
there ZZ0
, ZZ0
imprisoned ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
he ZZ0
spoke ZZ0
a ZZ0
single ZZ0
word ZZ0
. ZZ0
" ZZ0
No ITJ

Shaking ZZ0
with ZZ0

her ZZ0

have ZZ0
broken ZZ0
free ZZ0
even ZZ0
if ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0
now ZZ0
that ZZ0
this ZZ0
powerlessness ZZ0
was ZZ0
important ZZ0
to ZZ0
him ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
his ZZ0
act ZZ0
and ZZ0
his ZZ0
alone ZZ0
. ZZ0
Compelled ZZ0
, ZZ0
absolved ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
given ZZ0
no ZZ0
choice ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
, ZZ0
thirty ZZ0
years ZZ0
later ZZ0
, ZZ0
lying ZZ0
rigid ZZ0
, ZZ0
her ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
fixed ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
sky ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
remembered ZZ0
that ZZ0
single ZZ0
word ZZ0

his ZZ0
eyes ZZ0
looking ZZ0
into ZZ0
hers ZZ0
, ZZ0
his ZZ0
hands ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
shoulders ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
bark ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
tree ZZ0
scraping ZZ0
her ZZ0
back ZZ0
through ZZ0
her ZZ0
Aertex ZZ0
shirt ZZ0
. ZZ0
Time ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
stop ZZ0

remember ZZ0
now ZZ0
how ZZ0
long ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
held ZZ0
her ZZ0
imprisoned ZZ0
, ZZ0
only ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
an ZZ0
eternity ZZ0
of ZZ0
immeasurable ZZ0
time ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
last ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
gave ZZ0
a ZZ0
sigh ZZ0
and ZZ0
said ZZ0
: ZZ0
" ZZ0

" ZZ0
And ZZ0
that ZZ0
, ZZ0
too ZZ0
, ZZ0
amazed ZZ0
her ZZ0

that ZZ0
he ZZ0
should ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
thinking ZZ0
so ZZ0
clearly ZZ0

calculating ZZ0
how ZZ0

the ZZ0
window ZZ0
was ZZ0
covered ZZ0
with ZZ0
an ZZ0
oak ZZ0
dresser ZZ0
, ZZ0
very ZZ0
old ZZ0
and ZZ0
probably ZZ0
valuable ZZ0
, ZZ0
if ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
possible ZZ0
to ZZ0
remove ZZ0
it ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
wall ZZ0
without ZZ0
its ZZ0
collapse ZZ0

and ZZ0
the ZZ0
original ZZ0
row ZZ0
of ZZ0
bells ZZ0
still ZZ0
hung ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
door ZZ0
each ZZ0
with ZZ0
its ZZ0
Gothic ZZ0
script ZZ0
; ZZ0
drawing ZZ0
room ZZ0
, ZZ0
dining ZZ0
room ZZ0
, ZZ0
study ZZ0
, ZZ0
nursery ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
to ZZ0
challenge ZZ0
rather ZZ0
than ZZ0
enhance ZZ0
the ZZ0
skills ZZ0
of ZZ0
any ZZ0
cook ZZ0
ambitious ZZ0
beyond ZZ0
the ZZ0
boiling ZZ0
of ZZ0
eggs ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
now ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
noticed ZZ0
its ZZ0
deficiencies ZZ0
. ZZ0
Like ZZ0
the ZZ0
rest ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
become ZZ0
home ZZ0
. ZZ0
After ZZ0
the ZZ0
stridency ZZ0
and ZZ0
aggression ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
school ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
hate-mail ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
happy ZZ0
to ZZ0
find ZZ0
her ZZ0
temporary ZZ0
asylum ZZ0
in ZZ0
this ZZ0
gentle ZZ0
household ZZ0
where ZZ0
voices ZZ0
were ZZ0
never ZZ0
raised ZZ0
, ZZ0
where ZZ0
no ZZ0
one ZZ0
obsessively ZZ0
analysed ZZ0
her ZZ0
every ZZ0
sentence ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
hope ZZ0
of ZZ0
detecting ZZ0
racist ZZ0
, ZZ0
sexist ZZ0
or ZZ0
fascist ZZ0
undertones ZZ0
, ZZ0
where ZZ0
words ZZ0
meant ZZ0
what ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
meant ZZ0
for ZZ0
generations ZZ0
, ZZ0
where ZZ0
obscenities ZZ0
were ZZ0
unknown ZZ0
or ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
unspoken ZZ0
, ZZ0
where ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
the ZZ0
grace ZZ0
of ZZ0
good ZZ0
order ZZ0
symbolized ZZ0
for ZZ0
her ZZ0
in ZZ0
Mr ZZ0
Copley ZZ0
's ZZ0
reading ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
Church ZZ0
's ZZ0
daily ZZ0
offices ZZ0
, ZZ0
Morning ZZ0
Prayer ZZ0
and ZZ0
Evensong ZZ0
. ZZ0
Sometimes ZZ0
she ZZ0
saw ZZ0
the ZZ0
three ZZ0
of ZZ0
them ZZ0
as ZZ0
expatriates ZZ0
, ZZ0
stranded ZZ0
in ZZ0
some ZZ0
remote ZZ0
colony ZZ0
, ZZ0
obstinately ZZ0
adhering ZZ0
to ZZ0
old ZZ0
customs ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
lost ZZ0
way ZZ0
of ZZ0
life ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
they ZZ0
did ZZ0
to ZZ0
old ZZ0
forms ZZ0
of ZZ0
worship ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
grown ZZ0
to ZZ0
like ZZ0
both ZZ0
her ZZ0
employers ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
respected ZZ0
Simon ZZ0
Copley ZZ0
more ZZ0
if ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
less ZZ0
prone ZZ0
to ZZ0
venial ZZ0
selfishness ZZ0
, ZZ0
less ZZ0
preoccupied ZZ0
with ZZ0
his ZZ0
physical ZZ0
comfort ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
this ZZ0
she ZZ0
told ZZ0
herself ZZ0
was ZZ0
probably ZZ0
the ZZ0
result ZZ0
of ZZ0
fifty ZZ0
years ZZ0
of ZZ0
spoiling ZZ0
by ZZ0
a ZZ0
devoted ZZ0
wife ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
he ZZ0
loved ZZ0
his ZZ0
wife ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
relied ZZ0
on ZZ0
her ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
respected ZZ0
her ZZ0
judgement ZZ0
. ZZ0
How ZZ0
lucky ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
thought ZZ0
; ZZ0
secure ZZ0
in ZZ0
each ZZ0
other ZZ0
's ZZ0
affection ZZ0
and ZZ0
presumably ZZ0
fortified ZZ0
in ZZ0
increasing ZZ0
age ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
certainty ZZ0
that ZZ0
if ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
n't ZZ0
granted ZZ0
the ZZ0
grace ZZ0
of ZZ0
death ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
same ZZ0
day ZZ0
there ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
no ZZ0
lasting ZZ0
separation ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
did ZZ0
they ZZ0
really ZZ0
believe ZZ0
this ZZ0
? ZZ0
She ZZ0
would ZZ0
like ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
asked ZZ0
them ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
impossibly ZZ0
presumptuous ZZ0
. ZZ0
Surely ZZ0
they ZZ0
must ZZ0
have ZZ0
some ZZ0
doubts ZZ0
, ZZ0
made ZZ0
some ZZ0
mental ZZ0
reservations ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
creed ZZ0
they ZZ0
so ZZ0
confidently ZZ0
recited ZZ0
morning ZZ0
and ZZ0
night ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
perhaps ZZ0
what ZZ0
mattered ZZ0
at ZZ0
eighty ZZ0
was ZZ0
habit ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
body ZZ0
no ZZ0
longer ZZ0
interested ZZ0
in ZZ0
sex ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
mind ZZ0
no ZZ0
longer ZZ0
interested ZZ0
in ZZ0
speculation ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
smaller ZZ0
things ZZ0
in ZZ0
life ZZ0
mattering ZZ0
more ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
large ZZ0
and ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
end ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
slow ZZ0
realization ZZ0
that ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
really ZZ0
mattered ZZ0
at ZZ0
all ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
job ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
arduous ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0
that ZZ0
gradually ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
taking ZZ0
on ZZ0
much ZZ0
more ZZ0
than ZZ0
the ZZ0
advertisement ZZ0
had ZZ0
suggested ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
sensed ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
main ZZ0
anxiety ZZ0
of ZZ0
their ZZ0
life ZZ0
was ZZ0
whether ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
stay ZZ0
. ZZ0
Their ZZ0
daughter ZZ0
had ZZ0
provided ZZ0
all ZZ0
the ZZ0
labour-saving ZZ0
devices ZZ0
: ZZ0
dishwasher ZZ0
, ZZ0
washing ZZ0
machine ZZ0
, ZZ0
spin-dryer ZZ0
, ZZ0
all ZZ0
housed ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
disused ZZ0
still ZZ0
room ZZ0
near ZZ0
the ZZ0
back ZZ0
door ZZ0
, ZZ0
although ZZ0
until ZZ0
she ZZ0
came ZZ0
the ZZ0
Copleys ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
reluctant ZZ0
to ZZ0
use ZZ0
them ZZ0
in ZZ0
case ZZ0
they ZZ0
could ZZ0
n't ZZ0
turn ZZ0
them ZZ0
off ZZ0
, ZZ0
visualizing ZZ0
the ZZ0
machines ZZ0
whirling ZZ0
away ZZ0
all ZZ0
night ZZ0
, ZZ0
overheating ZZ0
, ZZ0
blowing ZZ0
up ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
whole ZZ0
rectory ZZ0
pulsating ZZ0
with ZZ0
an ZZ0
uncontrollable ZZ0
power ZZ0
. ZZ0
Their ZZ0
only ZZ0
child ZZ0
lived ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
manor ZZ0
house ZZ0
in ZZ0
Wiltshire ZZ0
and ZZ0
rarely ZZ0
visited ZZ0
, ZZ0
although ZZ0
she ZZ0
telephoned ZZ0
frequently ZZ0
, ZZ0
usually ZZ0
at ZZ0
inconvenient ZZ0
times ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
she ZZ0
who ZZ0
had ZZ0
interviewed ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0
and ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
now ZZ0
found ZZ0
it ZZ0
difficult ZZ0
to ZZ0
connect ZZ0
that ZZ0
confident ZZ0
, ZZ0
tweeded ZZ0
, ZZ0
slightly ZZ0
aggressive ZZ0
woman ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
two ZZ0
gentle ZZ0
old ZZ0
people ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0
, ZZ0
although ZZ0
they ZZ0
would ZZ0
never ZZ0
have ZZ0
dreamt ZZ0
of ZZ0
telling ZZ0
her ZZ0
, ZZ0
perhaps ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
even ZZ0
admit ZZ0
it ZZ0
to ZZ0
themselves ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
afraid ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
bullied ZZ0
them ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
claimed ZZ0
, ZZ0
for ZZ0
their ZZ0
own ZZ0
good ZZ0
. ZZ0
Their ZZ0
second ZZ0
greatest ZZ0
fear ZZ0
was ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
might ZZ0
be ZZ0
forced ZZ0
to ZZ0
comply ZZ0
with ZZ0
her ZZ0
frequently ZZ0
telephoned ZZ0
suggestion ZZ0
, ZZ0
made ZZ0
purely ZZ0
from ZZ0
a ZZ0
sense ZZ0
of ZZ0
duty ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
should ZZ0
go ZZ0
to ZZ0
stay ZZ0
with ZZ0
her ZZ0
until ZZ0
the ZZ0
Whistler ZZ0
was ZZ0
caught ZZ0
. ZZ0
Unlike ZZ0
their ZZ0
daughter ZZ0
, ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
could ZZ0
understand ZZ0
why ZZ0
, ZZ0
after ZZ0
retirement ZZ0
, ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
used ZZ0
all ZZ0
their ZZ0
savings ZZ0
to ZZ0
buy ZZ0
the ZZ0
rectory ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
in ZZ0
old ZZ0
age ZZ0
burdened ZZ0
themselves ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
mortgage ZZ0
. ZZ0
Mr ZZ0
Copley ZZ0
had ZZ0
in ZZ0
youth ZZ0
been ZZ0
a ZZ0
curate ZZ0
at ZZ0
Larksoken ZZ0
when ZZ0
the ZZ0
Victorian ZZ0
church ZZ0
was ZZ0
still ZZ0
standing ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0
that ZZ0
ugly ZZ0
repository ZZ0
of ZZ0
polished ZZ0
pine ZZ0
, ZZ0
acoustic ZZ0
tiles ZZ0
and ZZ0
garish ZZ0
, ZZ0
sentimental ZZ0
stained ZZ0
glass ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
and ZZ0
his ZZ0
wife ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
married ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
flat ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
rectory ZZ0
, ZZ0
living ZZ0
above ZZ0
the ZZ0
parish ZZ0
priest ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
made ZZ0
their ZZ0
first ZZ0
home ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
church ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
partly ZZ0
demolished ZZ0
by ZZ0
a ZZ0
devastating ZZ0
gale ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
1930s ZZ0
, ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
secret ZZ0
relief ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
Church ZZ0
Commissioners ZZ0
who ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
considering ZZ0
what ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
building ZZ0
of ZZ0
absolutely ZZ0
no ZZ0
architectural ZZ0
merit ZZ0
serving ZZ0
a ZZ0
congregation ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
major ZZ0
festivals ZZ0
of ZZ0
six ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
most ZZ0
. ZZ0
So ZZ0
the ZZ0
church ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
finally ZZ0
demolished ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0
, ZZ0
sheltering ZZ0
behind ZZ0
it ZZ0
and ZZ0
proving ZZ0
more ZZ0
durable ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
sold ZZ0
. ZZ0
Rosemary ZZ0
Duncan-Smith ZZ0
had ZZ0
made ZZ0
her ZZ0
views ZZ0
plain ZZ0
when ZZ0
driving ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
back ZZ0
to ZZ0
Norwich ZZ0

after ZZ0
her ZZ0

that ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
sixteen ZZ0

was ZZ0
still ZZ0

in ZZ0
that ZZ0
beautifully ZZ0

comfortable ZZ0

homely ZZ0

Early ZZ0
in ZZ0
their ZZ0

spend ZZ0
a ZZ0

in ZZ0
London ZZ0

Meg ZZ0

never ZZ0
again ZZ0

The ZZ0
door ZZ0
was ZZ0
usually ZZ0
open ZZ0
in ZZ0
summer ZZ0

, ZZ0
when ZZ0
shut ZZ0

always ZZ0
ring ZZ0

weight ZZ0

the ZZ0
trust ZZ0

had ZZ0
been ZZ0
so ZZ0
long ZZ0
without ZZ0

forgotten ZZ0

told ZZ0

accidental ZZ0
drowning ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
husband ZZ0
four ZZ0
years ZZ0
earlier ZZ0

she ZZ0
and ZZ0
Martin ZZ0
had ZZ0
needed ZZ0
only ZZ0
the ZZ0
occasional ZZ0
companionship ZZ0
of ZZ0
friendly ZZ0
acquaintances ZZ0
to ZZ0
affirm ZZ0
their ZZ0
self-sufficiency ZZ0
. ZZ0
Theirs ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0

those ZZ0
childless ZZ0

self-absorbing ZZ0
marriages ZZ0

unconsciously ZZ0
repel ZZ0

at ZZ0
intimacy ZZ0

The ZZ0
occasional ZZ0
dinner ZZ0
party ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
social ZZ0
duty ZZ0

could ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
wait ZZ0
to ZZ0
get ZZ0
back ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
seclusion ZZ0
of ZZ0
their ZZ0
own ZZ0
small ZZ0
house ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
after ZZ0
his ZZ0
death ZZ0
it ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
walked ZZ0
in ZZ0
darkness ZZ0
like ZZ0
an ZZ0
automaton ZZ0
through ZZ0
a ZZ0
deep ZZ0
and ZZ0
narrow ZZ0
canyon ZZ0
of ZZ0
grief ZZ0
in ZZ0
which ZZ0
all ZZ0
her ZZ0
energies ZZ0
, ZZ0
all ZZ0
her ZZ0
physical ZZ0
strength ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
husbanded ZZ0
to ZZ0
get ZZ0
through ZZ0
each ZZ0
day ZZ0

She ZZ0
thought ZZ0
and ZZ0
worked ZZ0
and ZZ0
grieved ZZ0
only ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
day ZZ0
at ZZ0
a ZZ0
time ZZ0
. ZZ0
To ZZ0
allow ZZ0
herself ZZ0
even ZZ0
to ZZ0
think ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
days ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
weeks ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
months ZZ0
or ZZ0
years ZZ0
stretching ZZ0
ahead ZZ0
would ZZ0
have ZZ0
been ZZ0
to ZZ0
precipitate ZZ0
disaster ZZ0
. ZZ0
For ZZ0
two ZZ0
years ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
hardly ZZ0
been ZZ0
sane ZZ0
. ZZ0
Even ZZ0
her ZZ0
Christianity ZZ0
was ZZ0
of ZZ0
little ZZ0
help ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
did ZZ0
n't ZZ0
reject ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
become ZZ0
irrelevant ZZ0
, ZZ0
its ZZ0
comfort ZZ0
only ZZ0
a ZZ0
candle ZZ0
which ZZ0
served ZZ0
fitfully ZZ0
to ZZ0
illumine ZZ0
the ZZ0
dark ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
when ZZ0
, ZZ0
after ZZ0
those ZZ0
two ZZ0
years ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
valley ZZ0
had ZZ0
almost ZZ0
imperceptibly ZZ0
widened ZZ0
and ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
for ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
time ZZ0
, ZZ0
not ZZ0
those ZZ0
black ZZ0
enclosing ZZ0
cliffs ZZ0
, ZZ0
but ZZ0
the ZZ0
vista ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
normal ZZ0
life ZZ0
, ZZ0
even ZZ0
of ZZ0
happiness ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
landscape ZZ0
over ZZ0
which ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
possible ZZ0
to ZZ0
believe ZZ0
the ZZ0
sun ZZ0
might ZZ0
shine ZZ0
, ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
become ZZ0
unwittingly ZZ0
embroiled ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
racial ZZ0
politics ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
school ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
older ZZ0
members ZZ0
of ZZ0
staff ZZ0
had ZZ0
moved ZZ0
or ZZ0
retired ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
new ZZ0
headmistress ZZ0
, ZZ0
specifically ZZ0
appointed ZZ0
to ZZ0
enforce ZZ0
the ZZ0
fashionable ZZ0
orthodoxies ZZ0
, ZZ0

moved ZZ0
in ZZ0
with ZZ0
crusading ZZ0
zeal ZZ0
to ZZ0
smell ZZ0
out ZZ0
and ZZ0
eradicate ZZ0
heresy ZZ0

Meg ZZ0
realized ZZ0
now ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
, ZZ0
from ZZ0
the ZZ0
first ZZ0
, ZZ0
been ZZ0
the ZZ0
obvious ZZ0
, ZZ0

There ZZ0

nothing ZZ0

her ZZ0
hot-water ZZ0
bottle ZZ0

There ZZ0
was ZZ0
no ZZ0
central ZZ0
heating ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
Old ZZ0
Rectory ZZ0

she ZZ0
seldom ZZ0
switched ZZ0

the ZZ0
two-bar ZZ0
electric ZZ0

in ZZ0
her ZZ0

, ZZ0
knowing ZZ0
how ZZ0

Finally ZZ0

hugging ZZ0
the ZZ0

checked ZZ0

made ZZ0
her ZZ0
way ZZ0
up ZZ0

On ZZ0
the ZZ0

scurrying ZZ0
furtively ZZ0

the ZZ0

Although ZZ0
there ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
cloakroom ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0

the ZZ0
Old ZZ0

only ZZ0
one ZZ0

going ZZ0
herself ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
bathroom ZZ0

Fifteen ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
later ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
in ZZ0

She ZZ0
knew ZZ0
rather ZZ0

felt ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
was ZZ0
very ZZ0
tired ZZ0

recognized ZZ0
the ZZ0
symptoms ZZ0
of ZZ0
an ZZ0
overstimulated ZZ0

in ZZ0
an ZZ0
exhausted ZZ0
body ZZ0

the ZZ0

inability ZZ0

The ZZ0
Old ZZ0

too ZZ0
far ZZ0
inland ZZ0
for ZZ0
her ZZ0
to ZZ0
hear ZZ0
the ZZ0
crash ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
waves ZZ0

the ZZ0
smell ZZ0

the ZZ0
throb ZZ0

always ZZ0
present ZZ0

In ZZ0
summer ZZ0
the ZZ0

, ZZ0
on ZZ0
stormy ZZ0
nights ZZ0

at ZZ0
the ZZ0
spring ZZ0

rise ZZ0

an ZZ0
angry ZZ0
moan ZZ0

She ZZ0
slept ZZ0
always ZZ0
with ZZ0
her ZZ0
window ZZ0
open ZZ0

would ZZ0
drift ZZ0
into ZZ0
sleep ZZ0
soothed ZZ0
by ZZ0
that ZZ0
distant ZZ0
murmur ZZ0

But ZZ0
tonight ZZ0
it ZZ0

no ZZ0

tonight ZZ0
even ZZ0
that ZZ0
shameful ZZ0

replaced ZZ0

disquieting ZZ0

And ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
on ZZ0
the ZZ0
verge ZZ0

she ZZ0
was ZZ0
crashing ZZ0
with ZZ0
him ZZ0
through ZZ0
the ZZ0

dreadful ZZ0
wood ZZ0

The ZZ0

it ZZ0

In ZZ0
those ZZ0
early ZZ0

had ZZ0
wanted ZZ0
her ZZ0

the ZZ0
magnitude ZZ0
of ZZ0
what ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
done ZZ0

that ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
done ZZ0
it ZZ0
for ZZ0

And ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
six ZZ0
weeks ZZ0
after ZZ0
the ZZ0

he ZZ0
had ZZ0
suddenly ZZ0

the ZZ0

lie ZZ0

now ZZ0

those ZZ0
half-suppressed ZZ0

in ZZ0
the ZZ0
last ZZ0
six ZZ0

his ZZ0

For ZZ0

She PNP

He ZZ0
knew ZZ0

at ZZ0

some ZZ0
insight ZZ0
into ZZ0
what ZZ0
those ZZ0
early ZZ0
shaming ZZ0

terrifying ZZ0
experiences ZZ0
had ZZ0
done ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0

Sometimes ZZ0
he ZZ0
thought ZZ0
that ZZ0

regarded ZZ0
his ZZ0

a ZZ0
casual ZZ0

slightly ZZ0
amused ZZ0

Once ZZ0
, ZZ0
after ZZ0
his ZZ0

she ZZ0

" ZZ0
And ZZ0
now ZZ0
he ZZ0
found ZZ0
himself ZZ0
wondering ZZ0
whether ZZ0
she ZZ0
knew ZZ0

guessed ZZ0
about ZZ0

And ZZ0
then ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
the ZZ0

from ZZ0

the ZZ0

as ZZ0
the ZZ0
late ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0

drained ZZ0
out ZZ0

the ZZ0

He ZZ0

recall ZZ0
every ZZ0

every ZZ0

the ZZ0
timbre ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0

the ZZ0

on ZZ0
his ZZ0

at ZZ0

She ZZ0
turned ZZ0

her ZZ0

the ZZ0
dunes ZZ0
had ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
with ZZ0
that ZZ0
burdened ZZ0
, ZZ0
ambitious ZZ0
, ZZ0
calculating ZZ0
scientist ZZ0
who ZZ0
ran ZZ0
Larksoken ZZ0
, ZZ0
nothing ZZ0
to ZZ0
do ZZ0
with ZZ0
Alice ZZ0

brother ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
Elizabeth ZZ0
's ZZ0
ex-husband ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
's ZZ0
ex-lover ZZ0
. ZZ0
Now ZZ0
he ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
mixture ZZ0
of ZZ0
irritation ZZ0
and ZZ0
dismay ZZ0
, ZZ0
whether ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
deliberately ZZ0
chosen ZZ0
to ZZ0
ignore ZZ0
those ZZ0
invisible ZZ0
keep-out ZZ0
signs ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
if ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
unconfiding ZZ0
, ZZ0
then ZZ0
so ZZ0
had ZZ0
she ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
knew ZZ0
little ZZ0
more ZZ0
about ZZ0
her ZZ0
now ZZ0
than ZZ0
when ZZ0
they ZZ0
had ZZ0
first ZZ0
encountered ZZ0
each ZZ0
other ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
abbey ZZ0
ruins ZZ0
on ZZ0
a ZZ0
blustery ZZ0
August ZZ0
evening ZZ0
less ZZ0
than ZZ0
six ZZ0
weeks ZZ0
earlier ZZ0
, ZZ0
had ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
minute ZZ0
stood ZZ0
and ZZ0
gazed ZZ0
and ZZ0
had ZZ0
then ZZ0
moved ZZ0
silently ZZ0
towards ZZ0
each ZZ0
other ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
wordless ZZ0
, ZZ0
amazed ZZ0
recognition ZZ0
. ZZ0
Later ZZ0
that ZZ0
evening ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
told ZZ0
him ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
came ZZ0
from ZZ0
Newcastle ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
her ZZ0
widowed ZZ0
father ZZ0
had ZZ0
remarried ZZ0
and ZZ0
that ZZ0
she ZZ0
and ZZ0
her ZZ0
stepmother ZZ0
could ZZ0
n't ZZ0
get ZZ0
on ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
had ZZ0
moved ZZ0
down ZZ0
to ZZ0
London ZZ0
and ZZ0
lived ZZ0
in ZZ0
squats ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
had ZZ0
sounded ZZ0
commonplace ZZ0
enough ZZ0
but ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
quite ZZ0
believed ZZ0
it ZZ0
and ZZ0
nor ZZ0
, ZZ0
he ZZ0
suspected ZZ0
, ZZ0
did ZZ0
she ZZ0
care ZZ0
whether ZZ0
or ZZ0
not ZZ0
he ZZ0
did ZZ0
. ZZ0
Her ZZ0
accent ZZ0
was ZZ0
more ZZ0
Cockney ZZ0
than ZZ0
Geordie ZZ0
. ZZ0
He ZZ0
had ZZ0
never ZZ0
asked ZZ0
about ZZ0
the ZZ0
child ZZ0
, ZZ0
partly ZZ0
from ZZ0
a ZZ0
kind ZZ0
of ZZ0
delicacy ZZ0
but ZZ0
mainly ZZ0
because ZZ0
he ZZ0
preferred ZZ0
not ZZ0
to ZZ0
think ZZ0
of ZZ0
her ZZ0
as ZZ0
a ZZ0
mother ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
had ZZ0
volunteered ZZ0
no ZZ0
information ZZ0
about ZZ0
Timmy ZZ0
or ZZ0
his ZZ0
father ZZ0

She ZZ0
said ZZ0

So ZZ0
she ZZ0
bore ZZ0
no ZZ0

It ZZ0
was ZZ0
n't ZZ0
important ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0

if ZZ0

she ZZ0
had ZZ0
decided ZZ0
to ZZ0
drop ZZ0
it ZZ0
, ZZ0
at ZZ0
least ZZ0
for ZZ0
now ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
he ZZ0
could ZZ0
put ZZ0
from ZZ0
him ZZ0
the ZZ0
treacherous ZZ0
suspicion ZZ0
that ZZ0
their ZZ0
first ZZ0
meeting ZZ0
had ZZ0
been ZZ0
contrived ZZ0
, ZZ0
part ZZ0
of ZZ0
a ZZ0
plan ZZ0
devised ZZ0
by ZZ0
her ZZ0
and ZZ0
Pascoe ZZ0
to ZZ0
exploit ZZ0
his ZZ0
influence ZZ0
with ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0

But ZZ0
that ZZ0
, ZZ0
surely ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
ridiculous ZZ0

He ZZ0
had ZZ0
only ZZ0
to ZZ0
recall ZZ0
the ZZ0
inevitability ZZ0
of ZZ0
their ZZ0
first ZZ0
coming ZZ0
together ZZ0
, ZZ0
her ZZ0
passionate ZZ0
, ZZ0
uncomplicated ZZ0
, ZZ0
animal ZZ0
gusto ZZ0
in ZZ0
their ZZ0
lovemaking ZZ0
to ZZ0
know ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
thought ZZ0
was ZZ0
paranoid ZZ0

He ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
here ZZ0
on ZZ0
Sunday ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
might ZZ0
be ZZ0
their ZZ0
last ZZ0

Already ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
half ZZ0
decided ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
had ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0

He ZZ0
would ZZ0
free ZZ0
himself ZZ0
from ZZ0
this ZZ0
enslavement ZZ0
, ZZ0
sweet ZZ0
as ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
, ZZ0
as ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
freed ZZ0
himself ZZ0
from ZZ0
Hilary ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
, ZZ0
with ZZ0
a ZZ0
regret ZZ0
which ZZ0
was ZZ0
almost ZZ0
as ZZ0
strong ZZ0
as ZZ0
grief ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
with ZZ0
this ZZ0
parting ZZ0
there ZZ0
would ZZ0
be ZZ0
no ZZ0
protests ZZ0

no ZZ0

no ZZ0
desperate ZZ0

Amy ZZ0
would ZZ0
accept ZZ0

calmly ZZ0
as ZZ0

accepted ZZ0
his ZZ0

the ZZ0
twenty-fifth ZZ0

And ZZ0
now ZZ0
time ZZ0

which ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
last ZZ0
ten ZZ0
minutes ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
mysteriously ZZ0
to ZZ0
have ZZ0
halted ZZ0
, ZZ0
flowed ZZ0
again ZZ0
and ZZ0
he ZZ0
was ZZ0
standing ZZ0
at ZZ0
his ZZ0
bedroom ZZ0
window ZZ0
five ZZ0
days ZZ0
later ZZ0
watching ZZ0
the ZZ0
great ZZ0
ball ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sun ZZ0
rise ZZ0
out ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sea ZZ0
to ZZ0
stain ZZ0
the ZZ0

spread ZZ0
over ZZ0
the ZZ0
eastern ZZ0

the ZZ0
veins ZZ0
and ZZ0
arteries ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
new ZZ0
day ZZ0

Sunday ZZ0
the ZZ0
twenty-fifth ZZ0

He ZZ0
had ZZ0
made ZZ0
that ZZ0
appointment ZZ0
five ZZ0
days ZZ0
ago ZZ0
and ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
one ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
would ZZ0
keep ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
lying ZZ0
there ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
dunes ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
n't ZZ0
known ZZ0
what ZZ0
he ZZ0
knew ZZ0
now ZZ0
, ZZ0
that ZZ0
he ZZ0
had ZZ0
another ZZ0
and ZZ0
very ZZ0
different ZZ0
appointment ZZ0
to ZZ0
keep ZZ0
on ZZ0
Sunday ZZ0
, ZZ0
September ZZ0
the ZZ0
twenty-fifth ZZ0
. ZZ0
Shortly ZZ0
after ZZ0
lunch ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
walked ZZ0
across ZZ0
the ZZ0
headland ZZ0
to ZZ0
Martyr ZZ0
's ZZ0
Cottage ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
Copleys ZZ0
had ZZ0
gone ZZ0
upstairs ZZ0
to ZZ0
take ZZ0
their ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
rest ZZ0
and ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
moment ZZ0
she ZZ0
wondered ZZ0
whether ZZ0
to ZZ0
tell ZZ0
them ZZ0
to ZZ0
lock ZZ0
their ZZ0
bedroom ZZ0
door ZZ0
. ZZ0
But ZZ0
she ZZ0
told ZZ0
herself ZZ0
that ZZ0
the ZZ0
precaution ZZ0
was ZZ0
surely ZZ0
unnecessary ZZ0
and ZZ0
ridiculous ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
would ZZ0
bolt ZZ0
the ZZ0
back ZZ0
door ZZ0
and ZZ0
lock ZZ0
the ZZ0
front ZZ0
door ZZ0
after ZZ0
her ZZ0
as ZZ0
she ZZ0
left ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
would ZZ0
n't ZZ0
be ZZ0
gone ZZ0
for ZZ0
long ZZ0
. ZZ0
And ZZ0
they ZZ0
were ZZ0
perfectly ZZ0
happy ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
left ZZ0
. ZZ0
Sometimes ZZ0
it ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
that ZZ0
old ZZ0
age ZZ0
reduced ZZ0
anxiety ZZ0
. ZZ0
They ZZ0
could ZZ0
look ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
power ZZ0
station ZZ0
without ZZ0
the ZZ0
slightest ZZ0
premonition ZZ0
of ZZ0
disaster ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
horror ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
Whistler ZZ0
seemed ZZ0
as ZZ0
much ZZ0
beyond ZZ0
their ZZ0
interest ZZ0
as ZZ0
it ZZ0
was ZZ0
their ZZ0
comprehension ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
greatest ZZ0
excitement ZZ0
in ZZ0
their ZZ0
lives ZZ0
, ZZ0
which ZZ0
had ZZ0
to ZZ0
be ZZ0
planned ZZ0
with ZZ0
meticulous ZZ0
care ZZ0
and ZZ0
some ZZ0
anxiety ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
drive ZZ0
into ZZ0
Norwich ZZ0
or ZZ0
Ipswich ZZ0
to ZZ0
shop ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
beautiful ZZ0
afternoon ZZ0
, ZZ0
warmer ZZ0
than ZZ0
most ZZ0
in ZZ0
the ZZ0
past ZZ0
disappointing ZZ0
summer ZZ0
. ZZ0
There ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
gentle ZZ0
breeze ZZ0
and ZZ0
from ZZ0
time ZZ0
to ZZ0
time ZZ0
Meg ZZ0
paused ZZ0
and ZZ0
lifted ZZ0
her ZZ0
head ZZ0
to ZZ0
feel ZZ0
the ZZ0
warmth ZZ0
of ZZ0
the ZZ0
sun ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
sweet-smelling ZZ0
air ZZ0
moving ZZ0
against ZZ0
her ZZ0
cheeks ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
turf ZZ0
was ZZ0
springy ZZ0
beneath ZZ0
her ZZ0
feet ZZ0
and ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
south ZZ0
the ZZ0
abbey ZZ0
stones ZZ0
, ZZ0
no ZZ0
longer ZZ0
mysterious ZZ0
or ZZ0
sinister ZZ0
, ZZ0
gleamed ZZ0
golden ZZ0
against ZZ0
the ZZ0
blue ZZ0
untroubled ZZ0
sea ZZ0
. ZZ0
She ZZ0
did ZZ0
not ZZ0
need ZZ0
to ZZ0
ring ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
door ZZ0
at ZZ0
Martyr ZZ0
's ZZ0
Cottage ZZ0
stood ZZ0
open ZZ0
as ZZ0
it ZZ0
often ZZ0
did ZZ0
in ZZ0
sunny ZZ0
weather ZZ0
, ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
called ZZ0
out ZZ0
to ZZ0
Alice ZZ0
before ZZ0
, ZZ0
in ZZ0
response ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
answering ZZ0
voice ZZ0
, ZZ0
moving ZZ0
down ZZ0
the ZZ0
corridor ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
cottage ZZ0
was ZZ0
redolent ZZ0
with ZZ0
the ZZ0
zesty ZZ0
smell ZZ0
of ZZ0
lemon ZZ0
overlaying ZZ0
the ZZ0
more ZZ0
familiar ZZ0
tang ZZ0
of ZZ0
polish ZZ0
, ZZ0
wine ZZ0
and ZZ0
wood ZZ0
smoke ZZ0
. ZZ0
It ZZ0
was ZZ0
a ZZ0
smell ZZ0
so ZZ0
keen ZZ0
that ZZ0
it ZZ0
momentarily ZZ0
brought ZZ0
back ZZ0
the ZZ0
holiday ZZ0
she ZZ0
and ZZ0
Martin ZZ0
had ZZ0
spent ZZ0
in ZZ0
Amalfi ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
trudge ZZ0
hand-in-hand ZZ0
up ZZ0
the ZZ0
winding ZZ0
road ZZ0
to ZZ0
the ZZ0
mountain-top ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
pile ZZ0
of ZZ0
lemons ZZ0
and ZZ0
oranges ZZ0
by ZZ0
the ZZ0
roadside ZZ0
, ZZ0
putting ZZ0
their ZZ0
noses ZZ0
to ZZ0
those ZZ0
golden ZZ0
, ZZ0
pitted ZZ0
skins ZZ0
, ZZ0
the ZZ0
laughter ZZ0
and ZZ0
the ZZ0
happiness ZZ0
. ZZ0
The ZZ0
image ZZ0
experienced ZZ0
in ZZ0
a ZZ0
flash ZZ0
of ZZ0
gold ZZ0
, ZZ0
a ZZ0
flush ZZ0
of ZZ0
warmth ZZ0
to ZZ0
her ZZ0
face ZZ0
, ZZ0
was ZZ0
so ZZ0
vivid ZZ0
that ZZ0
for ZZ0
a ZZ0
second ZZ0
she ZZ0
hesitated ZZ0
at ZZ0
the ZZ0
kitchen ZZ0
door ZZ0
as ZZ0
if ZZ0
disorientated ZZ0

Then ZZ0
her ZZ0
vision ZZ0
cleared ZZ0
and ZZ0
she ZZ0
saw ZZ0
the ZZ0
familiar ZZ0

the ZZ0

the ZZ0
