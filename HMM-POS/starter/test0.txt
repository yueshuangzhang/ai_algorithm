Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plate
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Sleep
would
perhaps
make
more
sense
after
thirty-six
hours
straight
on
duty
,
much
of
it
spent
with
a
sullen
Jamaican
who
had
killed
his
landlady
and
her
three
children
in
the
crowded
kitchen
of
a
house
behind
the
Westway
.
He
took
an
experimental
mouthful
of
fried
egg
and
waited
to
see
if
it
was
going
to
suit
him
,
then
progressed
to
the
baked
beans
,
cautiously
.
He
finished
the
egg
,
all
the
baked
beans
and
one
of
the
sausages
,
but
decided
the
fried
bread
was
tempting
fate
and
pushed
the
plate
aside
,
reaching
for
his
cup
of
tea
,
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table
.
He
lifted
a
hand
off
his
cup
in
weary
salute
to
one
of
his
sergeants.
a
very
dark
Scot
in
a
crumpled
grey
suit
who
was
walking
over
from
the
counter
,
and
the
man
altered
course
to
sit
opposite
him
.
"
How
goes
it
,
Bruce
?
"
Bruce
Davidson
had
accompanied
McLeish
from
his
last
posting
to
C1
,
that
division
of
New
Scotland
Yard
concerned
exclusively
with
murder
,
and
they
had
now
worked
together
for
four
years
in
the
CID
.
"
Got
that
Tottenham
case
weighed
off
,
nae
bother
.
I
hear
you
've
finished
the
Westway
job
.
Ye
need
to
get
your
head
down
,
John
,
you
're
looking
rough
.
"
McLeish
nodded
.
He
had
glanced
in
the
washroom
mirror
and
it
had
not
been
a
reassuring
sight
.
A
big
man
,
six
foot
four
inches
in
his
socks
and
a
good
fourteen
stone
,
he
always
looked
mildly
untidy
,
and
this
morning
,
having
worn
the
same
clothes
for
a
day
and
a
half
he
looked
like
a
football
supporter
after
a
night
in
the
cells
.
At
thirty-two
,
he
was
young
enough
not
to
look
completely
haggard
,
even
after
thirty-six
hours
with
only
the
odd
hour
's
sleep
,
but
his
dark
hair
was
plastered
to
his
head
and
the
brown
eyes
were
sunk
back
in
his
head
and
reddened
with
smoke
and
exhaustion
.
"
I
'm
going
off
.
You
too
?
"
"
I
'm
waiting
for
Catherine
-
Sergeant
Crane
.
"
Even
falling
asleep
as
he
was
,
McLeish
was
amused
at
Bruce
Davidson
's
hopeful
,
proprietorial
air
.
Catherine
Crane
had
joined
the
division
three
months
ago
,
creating
a
major
upheaval
.
She
was
a
slight
young
woman
of
twenty-seven
,
whose
dazzling
,
delicate
,
blond
looks
concealed
a
ferocious
intelligence
and
attack
.
Every
man
in
her
vicinity
had
found
himself
putting
his
best
foot
forward
,
and
she
had
done
wonders
